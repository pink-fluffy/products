            "top_reviews": "On a long and uncomfortable flight to Hawaii I managed to mess my back and tail bone really bad. I even paid to have a professional massage done because seating was impossibly painful and I work either driving around all day or in my home office. Nothing seemed to help. I considered getting one of those doughnuts cushions for people with \u201chemorrhoid problems\u201d but was too embarrassed to go to Walgreens looking for one. That\u2019s how I ended up here, looking for some relief. This stuff is magical, like seating on the back of a unicorn while coming down a rainbow. I sat down on it and all the pressure points were not giving me any issues, was able to drive out of state the next day NO PROBLEM. Outstanding quality, doesn\u2019t just squish down when you sit on it. The one issue is, you\u2019ll be pretty high up if you plan on using it in the car, but not a deal breaker compared to my coccyx not killing me and having shooting pain up my lag and back. BUY IT! The cover is also removable and washable."

First I had to confirm what I had wasn\u2019t any of that black market shady stuff that\u2019s been infiltrating the market. I mean how dare the kids of today not know what true real paper is. I remember when I was a kid..... alright enough of that next I\u2019ll be saying I walked uphill in snow both ways to school, but we had real paper.... ok sorry back to my fact finding mission. So I decided to go find old books. Feel, smell and against my better judgment (if I have any) taste test some to see what the quality\u2019s were that I so desired in my basic everyday needs of white paper to print on. Well one thing I can say is don\u2019t eat old paper it taste gross, I mistook them for those cool Candy dots on paper things when I was a kid many many years ago. Anyone remember those and Somehow you\u2019d always end up eating some of the paper, but wasn\u2019t an issue.... hmm maybe I should visit that factory to see what they desireD in paper to put candy on. In conclusion I came to the realization of why am I writing a review for paper at 3am on a Saturday instead of sleeping, so since I am, I will make it long as possible to see who actually reads this all oh yea and Amazon reviews all reviews not sure if they got a basement full of gremlins just sitting their reading what we type or some computer system that picks up on certain things and rejects based upon that? Either way if they have gremlins doing the work, I wonder if they print out their review decisions and what they think of normal basic white paper???? either way have a great day whenever you read this wherever you are and if you need some basic white paper to print on, I guess this should fit your needs."

If using these for the Rocketbook try to vary your notes color. For stuff that is \"formal\" that I will share with the team I stick with Black for notes, Red for commands, Blue for explaining commands.

            "top_reviews": "I am impressed by these pads. In reading the comments, I think your level of satisfaction depends on your intended use and a little common sense. These are everyday pads, not the Gold pads, so they are made from 16 lb paper, have a thin backing, and no cover. So, to expect them to withstand rain, markers, and wear and tear is silly and obviously not what they were designed for. These pads are best used as a refill in a padfolio (longer term) or a clipboard (short term) in situations where you need to capture or share handwritten information - in a compact and convenient way - such as in a briefcase or carried with you to a meeting. The 16 lb paper and thin backing keeps the pad thin enough to fit inside a case with a laptop, books, or other carry alongs where if too thick you have to jettison paper altogether. The pad is used for a short period of time and often one sided - as unlike a spiral bound notebook, pages as flipped back behind the padfolio or clipboard. There is no need for a cover to protect the oages from curling or getting wet because the padfoilio takes care if that. It enables the user to invest in a thin protective leather case and buy cheap refills. The other thing that I like about these pads is that the paper is really smooth. With these and the Sanford Jetstream pens, I feel like I am treating myself. And, as I normally type, handwriting is rare, so I like the fact that there is less hand fatigue and drag to slow me down and make my handwriting sloppy. So, these pads are great for rigorous use if in a protective cover. If you are looking for the pad to provide the protection, pay more for 20 lb paper, a thick stiff backing, and/or a cover. Those run $2 each not $1 each. If you are looking for a staple bound but perforated pad for your padfolio that is thin enough to take with you and smooth enough to enjoy writing on, these are a great deal."

IRK! While cleaning the lids and pens from the mess I\"d created, I noticed that water ran straight through the lids. DUH, no wonder why the tips are drying out! I slightly dampened the pen tips with an old cloth, sealed the lids with packing tape so air could not penetrate and reach the pen, stored them upside down for a few hours, and VIOLA, they work beautifully now. There is probably a logical explanation why expo manufactures the lids for airflow, but the reason escapes me. For now, my pens work and that\"s all that matters to me. Hope this helps someone else."

Foolishly, I dismissed those reviews -- all seemed inexact, and too subjective. I shouldn\\\"t have. These folders really ARE thinner than normal, insufficiently robust to be used for anything but the lightest filing needs. Very often, I need to add a two-hole punch to the tops of the folders I\\\"m using, then add a two-prong clip. That\\\"s just not practical with these folders; such heavy use would tear them to pieces quickly.  A huge problem here is the absolute absence of information provided by the manufacturer and/or seller. Card stock is typically reported by \"points\" or \"mils.\" This is the thickness of a sheet in thousandths of an inch. Such info would be enormously useful for consumers trying to decide which products to purchase blind. A typical business card is about 9.5 pt., while a grocery sack is around 7.6 pt. These folders are pretty close to the lightest business cards I\\\"ve collected in recent months, so around 9 pts. I\\\"ll bet a better (more \"standard\") file folder would be around 10-11 points. (Or alternately, by paper weight: card stock ranges from 50 to 110 pounds). Why doesn\\\"t Amazon or the seller provide this kind of information? Without it, you ARE buying blind. With it, you could more intelligently balance out cost v. need.  Anyhow, only two stars because these are NOT truly \"standard\" filer folders. They are perfectly usable for light long-term filing, but not for adding 2-prong clips or frequent reference use."

I have purchased these ink cartridges for years from my local brick and mortar store. I have never had a problem with the cartridges. I thought I would start purchasing from Amazon since I purchase so many other items from Amazon! Once I finally got my printer to accept the cartridge, everything that printed smeared badly. I tried printing the alignment page twice, but it smeared as well. I have never had this happen with the cartridges I\\\"ve purchased in the past or with my printer. The product is still under warranty, but HP recommended online that I contact the seller to return the item. I didn\\\"t open this item until almost 45 days after making the purchase, therefore I can\\\"t return it, since the seller has a 30 day return policy. I may have just received a bad cartridge, but if you purchase this item, please check it soon after purchasing to ensure it is working properly since you only have 30 days to return the item. I went back to my local store and purchased two cartridges and both worked fine.  Update: I tried repeatedly to contact HP with no luck. The box states that the product does have a warranty, but I can\\\"t get HP to back that up. I have tried calling and I spoke to them on \"chat\" and they can\\\"t even tell me how to return the item to HP for a refund or exchange! I am completely out of the money I spent on this cartridge."

I don\"t want to watch ads but Amazon wants me to watch ads. So IMDB video is filling up my feed when I\"m not interested in it. 3) Amazon moved quite a few things out of Prime Video which was free and stuck it into IMDB so I have to watch ads. This made the Amazon Prime subscription less valuable. 4) Amazon recently start rejecting non-fiction content from independent content creators. Hell I can\"t count how many bigfoot, UFO, fitness videos and independent documentaries I watched on Prime. Now they took a good deal of this and moved it out of free for Prime and they aren\"t letting people submit any new non-fiction content now. 5) I got Roku yesterday and the picture quality is actually better. 6) The Prime Video app on Roku is actually more navigable and easier to find Free for Prime content that the FireTV ecosystem."

I hope this helps others with seemingly unsolved issues with firesticks.  Firstly I\u2019ve been using firesticks even before 4K TVs and they\u2019ve almost always have worked well. The occasional restart/reboot on older models were something my family got used to. I eventually replaced all older units with this 4K version. And now never have to reboot. Although this has slightly better remote function, it\u2019s essentially the same as the 2018/2019 version. The 4K Max has the spec bump and quicker less congested WiFi 6 configurations.  Okay, so my biggest gripe with the firestick had to do with it not always playing HDR or Dolby Vision, which defeats the purpose of it being a 4K model. I\u2019ve scoured tons of forums and looked at countless YouTube videos regarding this. But either the solutions didn\u2019t work, or they would only be HDR 10 when the nicer Dolby Vision was available.  SOLUTION: Make sure your 4K tv setting are set properly. Go into \u201cINPUT\u201d settings and find the HDMI input you\u2019re using for the firestick and depending on your model make sure \u201cUHD\u201d is toggled on. This solution finally allowed every content I\u2019ve played on all streaming services to finally play Dolby Vision content (and HDR when DV was not) every single time. I hope this helps."

            "top_reviews": "Pros:__________ \u2022 No weight issues what-so-ever. There will be no problems with this on keys, bags, etc. \u2022 A simple compact design that doesn\u2019t draw attention. \u2022 Setup took seconds to get ready as the software is already on the current IOS. \u2022 Waterproof with an IP67 rating. This means it can take the rain or even if it\u2019s dropped in a deep puddle. Overall, it can hold against Mother Nature. \u2022 Battery replacement is quick and painless. \u2022 Thank you Apple for not making your own expensive battery for this. The battery inside is a CR2032. These usually last one year and are super cheap to get. You can find them at the checkout lines of a grocery store such as Walmart (and of course Amazon). \u2022 With Apple\u2019s ultra wideband technology, the precision location feature is the highlight for this device. If you\u2019re in the area of your Airtag, this feature will guide you to where the tracker is. I put my Airtag in a book, under my bed, even in the fridge and my iPhone 12 gave me visual arrows on where to go. When I got near it, the speakers on it begin the beep. This method is fantastic because you\u2019re able to use sight and sound to find your Airtag. \u2022 Left my Airtag near my colleague and walked probably one block away from the location. I turned on the lost mode, which will be in the setting of Apple\u2019s \u201cFind My\u201d app, and boom, showed me right where I left it. This is thanks because my colleague had an iPhone 11 and my Airtag was able to connect with it. By putting it in lost mode, it allows other your Airtag to connect with other Apple iPhones in order to help you see where it was last spotted. \u2022 Adding from above, my colleague was able to quickly scan my Airtag, revealing the contact info that I approved. The whole process took less than 20 seconds for him. \u2022 In regards to privacy, your Airtag doesn\u2019t store your location data for public viewing. All info about your location is encrypted and anonymized. \u2022 No fear of being tracked because if someone puts their Airtag near/on you, your iPhone will notify you if there is an Airtag near you (the current IOS already has the software to notify you, even if you don\u2019t have an Airtag). Just like the one ring from LOTR, it wants to be found. \u2022 I felt the speakers on the device are loud enough to not only grab your attention but also grab the attention of strangers, if you left it in a public location. \u2022 Overall, all Airtags that are separated from their owners, for a while, will play its beeping sound in order to alert anyone around. \u2022 You don\u2019t need to have Bluetooth always on for your iPhone. In other words, it will not affect the battery usage of the phone itself. \u2022 Yes, you can have more than one Airtag on file for your iPhone to track. \u2022 If you borrowed your friend\u2019s bag, which has on their own Airtag, you can choose to pause the alerts on your end so it won\u2019t keep harassing you. \u2022 A neat perk I also found is when just to ask your Siri where your Airtag is, the Airtag\u2019s beeping chime will being to play. \u2022 The scanning feature works on any latest android phones. Anyone with an android will be able to scan the Airtag to reveal your contact info. Cheers to that.  Cons and Oks:__________ \u2022 The Airtag will scratch and you will need to accept it. My only advice is to stick with the white color because that will hide some of the worse scratches (except in the middle). \u2022 It\u2019s small enough to put it on a keychain but sadly too large/bulky to put it inside your wallet. \u2022 The accessories cost with this can almost equal what you paid the Airtag itself, even more. \u2022 If you have an Android this will not work. As mentioned, you\u2019re able to scan an Airtag to discover the contact info, but that\u2019s it. \u2022 This is not a device to be put on your dog, or your child, because the device will not give you \u201creal-time\u201d tracking. It relies on the connections with other iPhones to help give an accurate, but not exact, location. \u2022 If there are no iPhones in the area, or if you travel into the world of nature, this device will not work. The good news is that there are billions of iPhones throughout the world, but still not every location will have an iPhone (with an update IOS). \u2022 On average I got around an 20-30ft of distance that the Airtag can connect with my iPhone, while not losing the signal. This is alright, I know for some this might be a bummer (not to me). \u2022 You won\u2019t be able to share your location. It would be great to have this feature because it can no doubt help speed up tracking down your misplaced item, especially if you\u2019re not in the area and someone you know is. \u2022 The Airtag doesn\u2019t alert you if you leave it behind. You first have to realize that you don\u2019t have the item, then proceed to use your iPhone to find it. \u2022 No built-in altimeter. For example, if you lose your Airtag in a 20-story building, the Airtag will tell you it\u2019s in the building (if they\u2019re iPhone around) but won\u2019t be able to pinpoint the height level, or floor, it\u2019s on. \u2022 Important Note: I\u2019ve noticed a couple of times that if the Airtag was too far away for my iPhone to connect with it, and there were no other iPhones around, you\u2019re standing in a dead spot (not connection). If this happens you just need to walk around until the Airtag can connect with your iPhone. Still, as I stated above, the Airtag only works if there are iPhones in the area. \u2022 Apple\u2019s precision location is only available in the U1 chip, meaning only iPhones 11 and above will only able to use this feature. \u2022 There are some countries that will not work for Airtags, even if there are iPhones around. I was informed that countries such as like Russia and Indonesia, but this can be updated (something to keep an eye out, if you\u2019re traveling). \u2022 The more remote you are, the less reliable the Airtag is. \u2022 A lot of this system relies on good Samaritans to reach out to you if they find your Airtag. Sadly, this depends on where you live.  Bottom Line:__________  I see this device helping three types of people. One, the one that keeps losing their stuff in public places such as subways, buses, places where people are. Two, the ones that keep losing their stuff at home every day such as keys, purses, stuff you can\u2019t leave the house with. Three, a mix of both.  It\u2019s important to note that the Airtag isn\u2019t a \u201creal-time\u201d tracker. It only works if iPhones are in the area, so don\u2019t attach this to your dog. You will also get scratches on it, so accept that as well. Other than the precision location feature, it\u2019s the similar tracking technology that\u2019s out there. This also means it has the same flaws as well.  In the end, the Airtag is an effective tracking device, requiring nothing more than an iPhone, which most already own. I found the layout responsive, accurate, and overall a useful tool. What I loved most was the precision location feature, as I can see that as a lifesaver if you need to find something in a hurry. On top of all this, my thumbs up to Apple in regards to the privacy issue. The fear of someone knowing your location, or worse being tracked, is dead in the water. For a device like this, privacy is essential, and Apple understood it.  Overall: An excellent tracking device, but only built exclusively for the Apple community.  Hope I was a help to you.

This was a sour Disappointment for someone who is used to amazon improving on their devices yearly.  Complaints: 1. They shipped my Black echo, with a WHITE cord, In the past the cord color matched the device, why change? 2. The charger is Noticeably larger and cheaper looking, sporting rounded corners and a bulky design. 3. The sound quality vs my 2nd Gen Dot has actually gotten worse. This speaker lacks bass and is very \"hollow\" sounding. The gen 2 speaker blows the gen 3 out of the water, IMO they majorly cheaped out to get you other features like an Ai core and a bulkier bigger device, in bigger packaging, requiring more shiping cost, a poor trade off for quality. 4. Its fabric mesh, and construction seem cheaper than previous generations, it is significantly lighter than a previous gen (my guess is a small speaker magnet and more airspace due to its odd shape) 5. Its small, i thought the ball was cool, big and substantially, Like a speaker should be, but its tennis ball sized and looks like a childs toy, or a cheap bluetooth speaker you got for $5..... 6. It has this awful \"sheen\" to the plastic that makes it look like some Chinese garbage product.... 7. The buttons feel awful and cheap compared to previous generations.  Pros: It has underglow now.  Overall its clear this product was rushed, or had a strict budget in which a lot of its features, and quality were stripped. The gen2 dots are amazing, and if you weren;t going to make them better, why release a gen 3?  It costs more, its much much worse in basically every category, and in my opinion, is a complete fail. Its supreme selling a brick because you want it. Buy a gen2, you\\\"ll be happier"

            "top_reviews": "I hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon\\\"s alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification. Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here\\\"s the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don\\\"t give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it\\\"s enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you\\\"ll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn\\\"t want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming. I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night\\\"s sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner\\\"s pamphlet there is a way to turn this \"Feature\" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don\\\"t get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don\\\"t mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution."

            "top_reviews": "I pre-ordered this device in a final Hail-Mary that maybe, just maybe, Amazon had finally produced a device that actually works the way it\\\"s supposed to. Alas...  The Fire Stick 4K and the 3rd-gen Fire Stick both have a design flaw that affects users of multi-channel surround-sound receivers. When \"Surround Sound\" is set to \"Best Available,\" the device sends stereo content (from, e.g., live TV) to the receiver not in 2-channel PCM, but in a 5-channel \"wrapper\" with sound on the front left and right speakers and silence on the other three. This prevents the receiver from processing the pass-through signal into 5.1-channel pseudo-surround using, e.g., Dolby ProLogic II. The only workaround is to set \"Surround Sound\" to \"Dolby Digital,\" which has the side effect of downgrading Dolby Digital Plus content (from, e.g., Netflix or Prime Video) to the lower-resolution legacy format.  So, the user has three choices: (1) sacrifice the receiver\\\"s surround-sound processing capability for stereo content; (2) sacrifice the higher-fidelity DD+ for multi-channel content, or (3) cycle through the menus (Home -> Settings -> Display & Sounds -> Surround Sound -> ... ) each time and change the setting to actually get the desired sound mode. Or, the user can use one device for live TV and other stereo content, a second device for multi-channel content, and switch between devices (and remotes) each time to get the same effect.  This has been a known issue with the Fire Stick 4K for three years, discussed in the product forums, yet it never shows up in any independent reviews of these devices. My hope, obviously, was that Amazon had addressed and fixed it for the new 4K Max; I even contacted Amazon Support before pre-ordering to describe the foregoing design flaw and ask specifically if the new device would have it as well. I was assured -- twice -- that it didn\\\"t. It does. Not only has Amazon buried its head in the sand, it has purposefully built this same design flaw into two more devices: the 3rd-gen Fire Stick, and now the 4K Max.  To my knowledge, no other manufacturer\\\"s streaming devices have this problem, viz., require the user to jump through all these hoops to get DD+ surround and PL-II surround from all sources, or else do without one or the other. Every non-Amazon streaming device I have used sends stereo content to the receiver in 2-channel PCM (as does the 2nd-gen Fire Stick), and multi-channel content in DD+ where available; i.e., the pass-through audio works exactly the way it\\\"s supposed to.  Obviously this was the first thing I checked so I didn\\\"t bother to evaluate the device\\\"s other features and performance before it went right back in the box to be returned. If you don\\\"t use a separate sound system this device may work for you; I have no idea how it works with a soundbar but if you have a multi-channel surround receiver/speaker system, stay away from this and other Fire TV devices.  I think this is it for me as far as Amazon devices go; every one I\\\"ve bought has at least one annoying glitch like this, each more disappointing and exasperating than the last, and their tech-support associates either don\\\"t have a clue or flat-out lie. It\\\"s been a frustrating experience to say the least."

            "top_reviews": "I have used Tiles for a long time (for keys, my wife\\\"s purse, and our cats on their collars), and they work pretty well except that should the device be out of bluetooth range, you are counting on someone with the Tile app being near it to have it found.  So usually being an Apple fan (I have an iPhone 12, my wife an iPhone 11, we have two iPads, and two Macbook Pros), hearing Apple would be making one, and that you just need an iPhone to go by your lost item for it to be found, I was excited.  How could Apple make a product this bad, when they weren\\\"t even innovating? Literally all they had to do was copy the Tile and then throw their weight of the ubiquity of the iPhone behind it. But no.  1. I tested losing the tag by putting it my garage and then going out there with my wife\\\"s phone. I put her phone near the \"lost\" tag, and nothing happened on her phone or mine. It appears you have to actually pick up the tag and tap it on the phone for it to be found. If I thought people would do that, a simple printed lost label or the cat\\\"s collar tags would suffice. So much for any advantage there.  2. You cannot share tag between two people so useless for tracking devices multiple people in the house might need to find like a cat that got out. Unless the one phone set to the tag is there, you cannot find it (confirmed by Apple support). If that person is at work, a drive away, out of town, etc. forget it. Tiles can be shared among multiple people in the house, so either of us home can find a cat that got out, etc.  3. The volume is much too soft to be audible unless you are right in the same room. At that point the directions to the device finally work (the one new feature beyond my Tiles) but simply being able to hear the device would have worked too -- and moreover would work from adjacent rooms, which the directions and too-soft AirTag do not until you happen to enter the right room. Apple support confirmed there is no way to make the volume louder like my Tile volume.  4. For it to work, you are required to use two-factor authentication on your phjone. I don\\\"t need that for my phone (unlike my brokerage account or bank), and Apple has made two-factor a constant annoyance if enabled so I don\\\"t want to use it. But unless you turn it on, you cannot add an AirTag.  5. Relative to all the above, this is small as it at least has a solution. But it is an extra annoyance that Apple couldn\\\"t even include a small loop or hole so it can be attached to your keyring, cat tag, or really anything else without buying a holder which is the same price again or more for each tag and makes the whole thing much bigger (or perhaps drilling a hole in them, if you were willing to risk it).  I have never been so disappointed in an Apple product, nor ever so amazed that a new product from a major company that simply needed to copy an existing product to succeed would miss the mark so badly. Mine are being returned and I am back to my Tiles (which also have replaceable batteries). I just hope they never get out of bluetooth range, or that others keep their Tiles (perhaps like me after trying the AirTag) so they are still found if they do."

I am tech savvy so this thing shouldn\\\"t be as hard as it is to simply mount the doorbell to the mount. I just put my return in and was just frustrated all around. To get a new one would take almost a week. I decided to take a breath and a dab. I sat down and closely looked at the backing and the mount. YOU HAVE TO put alot of effort into sliding the mount on. Once you closely look at how the inserts go in line it up and push REALLY HARD sliding the doorbell down. It will slide and lock into place. It shouldn\\\"t be this hard to put on and I can see why people are leaving poor reviews. Trust me on this though and don\\\"t give up!  UPDATE: day 2 and so far so good. I\\\"ve realized the reason for it being so hard to put the mount on, its to make it VERY sturdy when the doorbell is attached. I\\\"ve read a review talking about this being easy to steal and I would have to disagree. The door bell isn\\\"t going anywhere unless someone takes a hammer to it. The picture quality is really good, the picture I uploaded to this review doesn\\\"t compare to the live feed view on my iPhone. This doorbell comes with an \"armed\" and \"disarmed\" mode so when you\\\"re not wanting 100 notifications because of birds flying by your doorbell you can disarm and when you leave the house or go to sleep you can arm, I found this convenient.  UPDATE#2: Its been over a month now and no problems whatsoever! I went out and bought a 128GB flash drive to put into the module and now my recordings are being saved straight to that. This makes life a lot easier when accessing stored clips and transferring that data to a PC. The doorbell is still nice and tight and working like a charm. For the price you cant really go wrong with this doorbell combo. I suggest purchasing the combo and not the stand alone doorbell itself unless you already have a module in your home."

This new firestick is super fast (equal to the Firestick 4k) and works great with my projector. While using the projector I have no TV or Volume to control with a remote; so, I didn\"t need those functions. My projector also only puts out 720. So again, no need for the 4k.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 10, 2019: 5/5 stars UPDATED REVIEW: June 30, 2019: 3/5 stars (I docked down two stars for issues mentioned in UPDATE # 3 and # 4, and issues with parental controls).  For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (1 Kindle Touch, 1 Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and 1 Kindle 10). I also own two Amazon Fire tablets (Kindle 7 \u2013 2015: 5th generation and Kindle 8 \u2013 2018: 8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the \u201cSaving Money on Purchases\u201d section.)  This device is Amazon\u2019s most recently refreshed (2019 \u2013 9th generation) Fire 7 inch Kids Edition Tablet (henceforth referred to as Fire 7 KE) at an excellent price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are tough to beat, and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.  I have spent the past few days interacting with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.  -THE BOX: The Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet enclosed in the Amazon Kid-Proof case, a quick-start guide, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.  - AVAILABILITY: a Black tablet with Pink, Blue, or Purple cases with built-in-stand.  - Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 KE model: --- Display size remains the same --- PPI remains the same at 171 --- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM. --- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone) --- Size specifications stay the same --- Two-year service plan remains the same --- 1-year subscription to FreeTime Unlimited with automatic renewal at $2.99 per month plus tax. Individuals can cancel this subscription at any time by contacting Amazon Customer Service or the Amazon Parent Dashboard.  - Summary of critical aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7 Kids Edition: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017. --- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from the prior version. --- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging. --- The new processors: Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 1.3 GHz] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad Core ARM Cortex-A7 1.3 GHz] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available. --- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version. --- Slight increase in weight (2.3 oz/66 grams) though this item feels sturdier than the preceding model. --- New built-in stand (definitely a beneficial feature).  - Technical specs and other details: --- Size: 8.7\u201d x 6.3\u201d x 1.0\u201d (220 x 161 x 25.8 mm) --- 171 pixels per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles. --- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback --- Internal Storage: 16 GB --- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases. --- Weight: 16.1 ounces (456 grams) --- Warranty and Service: 2-year worry-free guarantee: if it breaks, return it, and we\"ll replace it for free (Amazon really doesn\u2019t ask any questions). The value of this feature cannot be overstated. A tablet in the hands of a child is subject to several drops. --- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera --- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor --- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life --- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used) --- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication. No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. --- Bluetooth 4.1 LE --- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker. --- Built-in microphone  - Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series): --- No HD video viewing available --- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out) --- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker) --- Sound quality is average --- Amazon\u2019s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store, but this is a nifty device nevertheless. --- Amazon\u2019s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.). --- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced). --- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.  *** Please note that this product is only for Ages 3 and up as there is a Choking Hazard with small parts.  - Comparison between Fire 7 KE (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 KE (2018 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Weight: Fire HD 8 (16.7 oz, 474 g) vs. Fire 7 (16.1 oz, 456 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 8 (32 GB) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB) --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point) --- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.  - Comparison between Fire 7 KE (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 KE (2017 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8) --- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera) --- Weight: Fire HD 10 (23.3 oz, 660 g) vs. Fire 7 (16.1 oz, 456 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 (32 GB) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB) --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Yellow cover option) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)  ** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10 KE, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).  - Some useful features on Fire KE Tablets (not a comprehensive list). Please note that parental controls can be used to block all of the below-listed features. --- Accessibility: \u201cVoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system-wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.\u201d --- Surfing the web using Amazon\u2019s web browser - Silk --- Watching movies, TV shows, and listening to music --- Ability to read Kindle books. --- Ability to read the news using Washington Times --- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon\u2019s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. --- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc. --- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store. * Basically, this can function as both an adult and a kid\u2019s tablet (older kids or adults can use it by disabling FreeTime).  - Amazon FreeTime Unlimited --- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over \u201c20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids\" profiles to give them more access to apps and games.\u201d \u201cIn FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.\u201d Another unique feature is Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish! Hopefully, there will be even more language options in the future to help bilingual or multilingual families and also to help those who wish to learn additional languages. --- Parents also have the option \u201cto set educational goals and curfews, and manage content for up to 4 child profiles with easy-to-use parental controls.\u201d This is really not as intuitive as it should be and can be frustrating to use. I have docked down a star as this has yet to be comprehensively developed. --- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers an unbeatable value \u2013 I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after the 1-year subscription expires). Additionally, kids can\u2019t make any additional purchases without parental authorization so it protects parents from liabilities. *FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations but it is pretty intuitive and outstanding. Amazon has done an outstanding job in this process. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time. This is a great feature, so you don\u2019t have to constantly follow your kid saying \u2013 \u201cyou have 5 more minutes before to turn the tablet off.\u201d The automatic turn-off absolves parents from this responsibility, avoids a potential meltdown, and teaches kids to be time conscious.  - Testing: Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.  - Saving money on purchasing the Fire Tablet Kids Edition --- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $99.99. --- Customers should also know that they can easily trade-in their prior Fire tablet for Amazon gift cards (for $5-$25 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire. --- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point. --- Sometimes Amazon provides bundle sales on products (get 2 or 3 items for a substantial discount). This is something for consumers to consider.  - Conclusion: To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, parental controls related limitations, and a basic app store. Updates worth noting in this version include a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable Kids tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and has access to several education apps, games, etc. then the Fire 7 KE tablet is the way to go.  - UPDATE # 1 and # 6: June 11, 2019 & June 21, 2019: Fire HD 8 Kids Edition + Echo Dot Kid Edition (release date June 26, 2019)  I recommend the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 KE (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars ($30 more). This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB RAM vs. 1 GB RAM), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I would personally get this tried and true model especially in light of Update # 3 (below).  --- Amazon recently offered a bundle sale to purchase both the Fire Kids Edition Tablet and Echo Dot Kids Edition (colors can be chosen). Fire 7 KE + Echo Dot KE: $129.98; Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE: $139.98; and Fire 10 HD KE + Echo Dot KE:$199.98. I recommend the Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE for $139.98. One FreeTime Unlimited subscription can function across multiple devices and the best way to maximize it is in my opinion to get both these devices. I will soon post a comprehensive review on the Echo Dot Kids Edition once the device becomes available, but cannot cover it here because I have exceeded Amazon\u2019s review space limitations.  - UPDATE # 2 (June 12, 2019): FreeTime Unlimited --- The age-specific apps/books/games on this device are not always age appropriate. Consequently, parents need to review every thing prior to letting children get these resources. These apps play a critical role in the formation of the child especially with screen time usage increasing at astounding rates (especially among children). --- This brings me to my second point of concern \u2013 screen time. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 18 months have no screen time with the exception of video-chatting while children 2-5 years should have no more than 1-hour per day of screen time (only high-quality programs) with parents co-viewing these videos with the child (parental interaction is key for formation of language skills and holistic development. Just watching educational videos is insufficient \u2013 kids learn by back and forth interaction with adults). They have additional guidelines for children 6 and older, which includes monitoring the child\u2019s media usage, providing strict guidelines for use of media, etc. I would strongly encourage parents to review this information prior to purchasing this media device.  - UPDATE # 3: June 13, 2019: Battery Life Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I did experience occasional fluctuations in battery life (nothing major) and so am docking down half a star. So, please bear this in mind when making the purchase.  UPDATE # 4 & # 5: June 14, 2019 & June 19, 2019: Toys Story Headphone *Customers that preordered the item were supposed to get a free Toys Story headphone ($25 value). However, I never received it. I purchased this item in spite of the sound quality and low volume issues because of the free headphones. However, since I didn\u2019t receive the headphones, I am docking down a star because the cost of getting a good-quality kid headphone ($24.99) added to the cost of the Fire 7 ($99.99) is equivalent ($124.98) to getting the better sound quality and volume Fire 8 KE ($129.99) with no headphones required and several other features. Amazon did contact me about this issue and asked how they could remedy the issue. They offered me $ 25 credit (headphone value) or a free headphone which I am grateful for. However, I still docked half a star because Amazon would not have contacted me if it was not for my review.  Please also note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.  Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review."

I\\\"ve read over 50 books on it since I purchased it and I\\\"m a happy camper.  April 15, 2019 (Original review): I had a Kindle touch years ago and had stopped using it. But I want to be able to focus on reading and not pop-ups from other apps so I bought this new Kindle to avoid the distractions of reading on my phone.  The device is smaller than both my original Kindle touch and my husband\\\"s Kindle Paperwhite. I was able to quickly get connect to the internet and begin downloading Kindle books I checked out via Overdrive. The device can be held in one hand comfortably, and it\\\"s lightweight enough to feel quite portable without appearing flimsy.  This Kindle has some buggy-feeling holdovers from previous generations: occasional leftover pixels during page/screen pages. However, I find the touch screen to be responsive without being jumpy. The bottom/power button sometimes takes an extra push to activate, or perhaps just needs me to focus a bit more. I don\\\"t mind the \"special offers\" and generally ignore them completely, yes, this is a generally annoying feature, but I\\\"d rather spend that $20 on books. The backlight can be adjusted to read outdoors or in your bedroom in the dark (handy if your partner nags about keeping a booklight on).  Another reviewer commented on the PPI. Personally, as I don\\\"t use the device for pictures/illustrations/detailed charts, I frankly don\\\"t care. The images that appear in the special offers are clear enough, and the default sized print is crisp and clean and I have no issues reading without my glasses. If you frequently read books that are illustration/graphic-heavy, you may prefer a Paperwhite or other device.  I\\\"ll adjust my review if my sentiments change but for now I am very happy with my new Kindle."

This was a sour Disappointment for someone who is used to amazon improving on their devices yearly.  Complaints: 1. They shipped my Black echo, with a WHITE cord, In the past the cord color matched the device, why change? 2. The charger is Noticeably larger and cheaper looking, sporting rounded corners and a bulky design. 3. The sound quality vs my 2nd Gen Dot has actually gotten worse. This speaker lacks bass and is very \"hollow\" sounding. The gen 2 speaker blows the gen 3 out of the water, IMO they majorly cheaped out to get you other features like an Ai core and a bulkier bigger device, in bigger packaging, requiring more shiping cost, a poor trade off for quality. 4. Its fabric mesh, and construction seem cheaper than previous generations, it is significantly lighter than a previous gen (my guess is a small speaker magnet and more airspace due to its odd shape) 5. Its small, i thought the ball was cool, big and substantially, Like a speaker should be, but its tennis ball sized and looks like a childs toy, or a cheap bluetooth speaker you got for $5..... 6. It has this awful \"sheen\" to the plastic that makes it look like some Chinese garbage product.... 7. The buttons feel awful and cheap compared to previous generations.  Pros: It has underglow now.  Overall its clear this product was rushed, or had a strict budget in which a lot of its features, and quality were stripped. The gen2 dots are amazing, and if you weren;t going to make them better, why release a gen 3?  It costs more, its much much worse in basically every category, and in my opinion, is a complete fail. Its supreme selling a brick because you want it. Buy a gen2, you\\\"ll be happier"

            "top_reviews": "I bought this specifically because I was having trouble with my old Roku Premiere+ being able to stream YouTube videos in 4K. It would always default to standard definition or worse and never get any better. This should not have been happening, as I have 100 mbps fiber internet service. For reference, YouTube 4K requires 20 mbps, which I have 5x the requirement for.  So, I decided that because this model was touting \"long-range wireless\" that maybe this would remedy the problem. It did not. The claims are that this model has 2x the wireless speed of previous Rokus. Maybe this is true, but the actual speed it does get is absolutely terrible.  I have attached two pictures to this review. One is of the wireless speed that the Roku is saying it has (purple screen), which is 2 mbps. Bear in mind, this is about 10ft from my wireless router. The second picture is of a speed test that I ran (on the WiFi) of my iPhone literally laying on top of the Roku at the TV and it is getting 122 mbps up and down.  So, you can see why I am having so many issues with streaming in general with this thing. This device is only capable of utilizing 1.6% of the speed that my wireless router is delivering. My advice to most people looking at this thing, avoid at all costs. There are many other streaming options that will reliably deliver the speeds you need for proper streaming.  Update: 10/23/21  So, after a week of pulling my hair out with this thing, I decided to format it to return it. Thankfully, I decided to give it one last shot before sending it back.  I\u2019m glad I did, because after the format, it started miraculously working for about 3 days now. It gets 150+ mbps. I checked all of the settings to see what exactly had changed. Turns out it was my wireless router assigning a terrible channel to the Roku!! It put it on channel 1 initially. Same with my old Roku Premiere. Both were getting 2 mbps. For whatever reason, it assigned this Roku after formatting to channel 48 on my network and that fixed everything.  So, your mileage really may vary here. You may not have the router problem I had and it works flawlessly, or you may have the same or worse. I still kind of feel like this could be an issue involving Roku, like the Roku maybe should tell the router \u201cHey, this channel sucks, please give me a different one!\u201d  I have updated my review to 4 stars because it is the best streaming device out of all that I have tried. Roku is a great company with a great UI. I just can\u2019t quite give it 5 stars because of the WiFi issues because I don\u2019t know if the blame is fully on my router, since I don\u2019t have any other devices having issues."

The hardware and software are in the Kindle already, but they put a pay wall between you and accessing it. This is so unethical I will be making amazon pay for this with many many returns and lots of b.s. Also, You have no control over what amazon puts on your childs home screen. Why amazon feels it is acceptable to put Marxist anti american propoganda on your childs home screen is a point of concern. They say you have complete control but you have none.  DO NOT BUY THESE FOR YOUR CHILDREN unless you enjoy watching them cry in dissapointment when thr kindle dosent do what it is supposed to, everyday.

            "top_reviews": "Summary:  + Best screen of any Paperwhite or Kindle released to date + Best response time of any Paperwhite or Kindle + UI improvements + Weight and feel are exceptional  - Screen has uneven area with color temp on high brightness - Flipping through Library is still abysmal when large - Expensive - Previous Kindles still do things in much the same way  Coming from the 7th gen Kindle, this is a gigantic improvement on all fronts. The Paperwhite 2021 also handily beats the pulp out of the Paperwhite 2018 version due to its new LED array, and for my money it\\\"s a better choice than the Oasis 3 as well due to ergonomics. Add in some extra screen real estate compared to previous Paperwhites, a much nicer bezel, a few more options for the UI, and what we have is an extremely polished device for reading digital books. It\\\"s never going to make me switch totally from physical, but I will definitely be using this to read a lot more than my previous Kindle.  The screen here is nearly perfect, and it will be the main factor attracting those coming from the previous 2018 model. If things were cheaper, this would be an essential upgrade for most people. I would not do without it if given the choice. Feel free to browse all the negative reviews from 2018. They were all right. But now it seems Amazon has finally finished their beta device. The screen itself is more matte than shiny, easy to wipe off, clear but not distracting, and fully able to replicate a physical book with its expanded dimensions. The Oasis 3 for instance irritates me with its form factor. The Paperwhite 2018 has an ugly bezel as well. This is exactly what I wanted out of an E-Reader.  The Paperwhite 2021 is lit by 17 LEDs compared to 5 LEDs in the 2018 model, which leads to vastly superior balance. There are 24 gradations for both brightness and warmth, from off to mango warm, and they make a tangible and visible difference in proper aesthetics related to actual physical books. The color options are great, but after some use there still seems to be a portion equating to about the bottom half of the screen on mine that is a very slightly greener hue as opposed to a warmer hue on top. Very hard to pick up for some people, but it\\\"s worth noting for users that want to use this on high brightness. I usually only use around 6-12 brightness to get proper coloring, and it\\\"s not really noticeable in lit rooms with these settings. I usually use the lovely dark mode at night, so in the end I\\\"ll say this issue really doesn\\\"t affect me much.  Make no mistake, though, the 2018 Paperwhite had an awful screen, with a horrendous LED array, and this one is a massive upgrade. This 2021 version still has a fully stable lighting array that doesn\\\"t evoke a poor production run or haste in design, yet it\\\"s not perfect either. Blacks could definitely be deeper with an OLED screen or something of the sort. Dark Mode still looks good, but on higher brightness it appears a little too grey. Overall, I am satisfied at the advances that have been made, and my usual settings all look fantastic and so much better than anything before.  6.8 inches of screen along with 300 PPI is definitely enough to satisfy most demands for resolution, and the extra space may be convincing for one to switch from physical books. The bezel itself also looks properly designed finally. That alone is also another huge deal. The sides are thin, the screen is the main attraction, and there is no awkwardness in reading versus a real book. All additions that make this is a positive buy over the other Kindles.  There is an extremely tiny trail of adhesive in one corner and edge at the very bottom right near the backing material and black area of the bezel. Pretty minor all told. Most won\\\"t even notice things like this, and most Kindles will probably have such a minor flaw. Compared to the 2018 version, this thing seems like an actual professional product.  The UI responsiveness was another issue in previous models, and I am happy to report this one is very fast. Massively faster than my 7th gen, and a decent improvement over the older model. The Paperwhite 2018 uses a Freescale/NXP i.MX6 SoloLite 1 GHz processor. Not terrible, but also not quite enough to match the newer NXP i.MX7D 1 GHz chip used in the Oasis 3 and this model. Again, a more refined version at every level compared to the older Paperwhite.  For memory and storage, I can\\\"t see many people needing more than 8GB. I did fine on my last Kindle with much less. Unless you plan on starting a small library, 8GB of memory is a perfect fit for anyone\\\"s lifetime.  As for the user interface, major changes have resulted in a much better flow in overall design for most Kindles from 2015 onward. The swipe down mechanic is leagues better than anything they\\\"ve had before. The library UI that you tap in the upper left is again fast and finally consistent. These UI details are easy to spot in the included pictures with various lighting values. But they are available to most users outside of this product. The ONE MAJOR caveat, just like your Cart items for the regular Amazon site, is that Library is becoming absolutely obscene to sift through. It\\\"s not something that is okay anymore. They need a major list overhaul feature for people with hundreds of books. Amazon UI designers still have a lot of issues they need to fix, but since this applies to all Kindles, it doesn\\\"t have much to do with this particular device.  Response and animation are a cut above their predecessors, and that should not be understated. I finally feel the Kindle is quick enough for my needs with digital reading. My 7th gen was abysmal. The 2018 version was slightly problematic. The newer page turn animation, however, was not to my liking, and I ended up sticking with the normal style. As a plus, the web browser is snappy and usable for those that need to quickly look something up on a search engine. Exiting in and out of menus is a breeze, and opening or downloading books was efficient. I still wish there was a download all option, so I will be downloading from the website instead.  And speaking of default, the designers have made sure that this Kindle is ready to use without even touching a setting. They clearly invested a lot in understanding how people want their Kindle to look. I found almost all default options to be optimal. I added one step to boldness in fonts, and have toyed with the variable warmth quite a bit. Bookerly is a great font for reading, but there are obviously other options if you prefer. These things are basically as good as they need to be on this digital reader. More improvements with font selection could be possible, but are entirely superfluous to the current experience.  Updating the firmware was painless for me past having to click no thanks for all the subscriptions Amazon wants to get you hooked on. No thanks. No issues with connections or anything of the sort. Charging works perfectly via USB-C, a far better connector than the micro version. Adding and subtracting to the library was fast and convenient.  Aesthetics and materials are premium for the most part. Other than the aforementioned pinprick trail of adhesive, there were no outright imperfections that I can see. I don\\\"t really like the Oasis 3, but it\\\"s definitely similar to that version, with a better form factor.  The leather case included with this bundle is what it is: completely overpriced but nearly mandatory for the perfect feel and weight. I can\\\"t stand the feel of the device without the included case. I highly recommend the bundle. The aesthetics look nice, and overall it\\\"s mostly the same as my last one. A bit easier to get in and out compared to 7th gen.  At the heart of it all, this is still just another updated version of the Paperwhite. But it could be mandatory because it polishes the lighting and page turning to a degree that makes the old devices feel awkward. And that leaves two questions remaining: How is the battery life, and is this worth the upgrade if you own the 2018 version...  Battery life seems improved. I wouldn\\\"t call it all that great on full brightness, but it\\\"s definitely an upgrade from anything before. Battery life is critical, yet I have run into few issues with my normal settings. Right now, I can see that it drains decently fast on max brightness, but it also has an array of 17 LEDs lighting it. On lower brightness, it appears to be very conservative with battery life, much the same as last time but probably better. It\\\"s tough to say when you are comparing older batteries to newer ones. This will be an ongoing process to be updated in the review every now and then. On the lowest brightness it is off of course, for those that prefer the older Kindle experience and extended usage without a charge. This obviously produces a charge that lasts a very long time. With hibernation, I have no issues with battery life, but it\\\"s only a few months old.  Stemming from that thought, I see no reason to keep Wi-Fi on, and the complaints about that particular setting, coming from 2018, seem slightly obtuse. Shut it off when your library is downloaded. Problem solved. With full brightness, you aren\\\"t going to get a ton of life, but I also recommend against full brightness as it doesn\\\"t really resemble paper at that point. On medium settings, which I prefer, battery life seems completely acceptable and better than before.  If you are currently using a device below the Paperwhite 2018, then definitely you could think about an upgrade if you are in the market for a new E-Reader. I cannot overstate how much better this is than my 7th gen. I rarely even used that model, and I will definitely be clocking in some time with this one due to the screen and response time. It\\\"s a huge motivating factor to actually take out my Kindle now. Previous versions do not match up, and this is the first time I can say I am impressed by a Kindle. Dark mode is pretty awesome all told.  Coming from 2018, I would say this is a fairly huge upgrade, and most will want to eventually make the change. The screen is too versatile to pass up, and the faster response time basically nails the previous version in its coffin. I don\\\"t think an immediate upgrade is necessary, but most will want this as their baseline going forward. The 2018 version has too many issues, and this fixes most of them.  Economically, this might not be an option for many. To somewhat help out, you definitely will want to get this in the bundle with the leather case, which I included a picture of at the bottom. It\\\"s a nice case, way too expensive by itself, and kind of mandatory in my experience. The bundle also includes a trade-in option. Definitely DO NOT buy the case separately. No need to give Amazon any more of your money than necessary.  Outside of that you can be sure I will remain critical of this device. If anything goes wrong, becomes damaged or defective, I will immediately add that info to my review. No shilling is allowed here. Freezes have gone completely away as of the recent firmware update in 1.14.1.1.  For those on the fence, it is best to wait a few months to see how things turn out. For now, I enjoy the device and have only a few issues. Going forward I hope to actually use a Kindle consistently for the first time. If I rated the Paperwhite 2018 one star, then this one is around four stars. A worthy upgrade for"

The charger is Noticeably larger and cheaper looking, sporting rounded corners and a bulky design. 3. The sound quality vs my 2nd Gen Dot has actually gotten worse. This speaker lacks bass and is very \"hollow\" sounding. The gen 2 speaker blows the gen 3 out of the water, IMO they majorly cheaped out to get you other features like an Ai core and a bulkier bigger device, in bigger packaging, requiring more shiping cost, a poor trade off for quality. 4. Its fabric mesh, and construction seem cheaper than previous generations, it is significantly lighter than a previous gen (my guess is a small speaker magnet and more airspace due to its odd shape) 5. Its small, i thought the ball was cool, big and substantially, Like a speaker should be, but its tennis ball sized and looks like a childs toy, or a cheap bluetooth speaker you got for $5..... 6. It has this awful \"sheen\" to the plastic that makes it look like some Chinese garbage product.... 7. The buttons feel awful and cheap compared to previous generations.  Pros: It has underglow now.  Overall its clear this product was rushed, or had a strict budget in which a lot of its features, and quality were stripped. The gen2 dots are amazing, and if you weren;t going to make them better, why release a gen 3?  It costs more, its much much worse in basically every category, and in my opinion, is a complete fail. Its supreme selling a brick because you want it. Buy a gen2, you\\\"ll be happier"

The 16 GB of memory leaves me space to add more apps and the menu navigation is much snappier than the 4k stick\u2019s, most likely due to the Cube\u2019s hex-core processor. It came with an ethernet adapter so I set it up using wired ethernet out of curiosity. After using this configuration for two evenings I realized that the occasional buffering pauses that I had been seeing on my three Fire 4k sticks and Recast DVR, that are sometimes all in use at the same time, was due to a WiFi bottleneck even though I had good WiFi signal strength at all of the devices. I have since repurposed the long-ago abandoned ethernet cables routed throughout my house, added a new 8-port gigabit ethernet switch to my router, bought and connected Fire ethernet adapters for each of my Fire 4k sticks, connected my Recast DVR to ethernet (it already has an ethernet port on it) and have not seen a single buffering delay on any of my Fire devices since.

At first i thought it didn not support 75Hz and the colors were washed out and it was too bright, also on the nvidia panel it said 1080p at 60Hz however this is what you gotta do to fix it.  \"CALIBRATION\"  1. Connect via HDMI 2. Open Display settings and make sure that they are set so that only the 2nd display is turned on, do not put duplicate or extend. 3. Open Nvidia control panel and go to \"Change Resolution\" 4. You will see two lists, one will say HD, UHD etc, the other one at the bottom will say \"PC\", (changing the first list will project your laptop screen to the second screen however your laptop is 60Hz and the monitor is 75Hz that is why its limited to 60Hz and colors are washed out, changing the second list will basically use your laptop to power up the monitor at full 75Hz 1080p with the right color calibration.) 5. On list two \"PC\" change the resolution to 1080p and 75Hz  And there you go, now you can use your 75Hz monitor for gaming, make sure to change the settings indvidually in games to 75Hz or they will still run at 60Hz and the colors will be washed out.  Now onto the review  *** REVIEW *** The screen resolution is full 1920x1080p at 75Hz, the colors are very accurate, it looks no where near like a TN panel, I would say its in between a TN panel and an IPS panel but closer to IPS.  It comes with speakers which are ok for the price but I recommend headphones or your own speakers which are probably better if you got this for gaming.  This is what comes in the package - Monitor - 4 screws for mounting - Two screws for setting up the monitor (non adjustable height( - HDMI to VGA cable - VGA to VGA cable  I really recommend this monitor even if not for gaming, its a great price for what you get and it even comes with two cables.  However one thing to note is that the difference between 60Hz and 75Hz is hard to notice in games. Playing Witcher 3 and Rise of Tomb Raider at locked in 75FPS wasn\\\"t anything much more amazing than 60FPS. However it is still an improvement.  One last thing to confider if you\u2019re debating on a 75Hz vs 144Hz monitor - If you have a graphics card such as the GTX 770,970,1060 Most games (witcher, call of duty, battlefield wont go back 80 fps on ultra / high graphics) so you wont be able to take advantage of a 144Hz monitor, so I suggest this one. UNLESS you play on medium/low settings. - If you have a graphics card such as a GTX 770,780,980,1070 and above, I suggest the 144Hz monitor since these can run most tiles at well above 100FPS so you can take advantage of the monitor.  *** UPDATE *** Earlier on the review I said the difference between 60Hz and 75Hz was negligible, I take it back.  I played on my laptop which is limited to 60Hz and it feels bad and slugish compared to 75Hz, once you go higher refresh rate you can never go back  Its one of those things you dont realise until its taken away, great improvement."

I still would prefer a neutral tone to English, maximum volume is a mouthful to interrupt your listening. Upping to three Stars because I\\\"m still using the thing. The thing talks. When adjusting volume to max will SHOUT \"MAXIMUM VOLUME\". Power on will say \"Power On\", \"Connected\", etc. It\\\"s annoying as hell, and super disruptive, esp in the middle of the night. No way to disable this \"feature\" as far as I can tell. Please, stop making things talk. People have to listen to it again and again, every time. Neutral electronic sounds are best, or at least add functionality to disable speech! Would not purchase again. Connectivity, battery sound quality etc is good. It\\\"ll YELL at you when the battery is low, even if it\\\"s got a good 15 minutes or more. And keep Yelling \"Battery Low\" if you plug it in, must be powered off, charged a little and powered on again to get it to stop interrupting. It\\\"s a Demanding little thing!"

            "top_reviews": "I ordered my Ultra 2020 directly from Roku, as Amazon was back ordered. It arrived on Oct 16th, one day after the release date. I am using it to replace my Ultra 2018 model. I also have a second 4K TV with a Roku Streaming Stick+ as well as a Sharp Roku TV. I recently tried and returned the Fire TV Cube. So besides reviewing the 2020 Ultra, I will be making comparisons. The 2020 Ultra is advertised as being 30 percent faster than previous versions. If it is, I can barely notice. Not worth an upgrade if speed is your only motivation and you already have a 2018 or 2019 Ultra. What it does bring to the party is support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. I have a 4K TV and audio system that support both so the upgrade was worth it for me. I have found that Dolby Vision (offered on many Netflix Originals) is superior to standard HDR. If you\\\"re not as fussy as I am about getting maximum picture quality, getting Dolby Vision might not matter to you. The Fire TV Cube does support both Atmos and Dolby Vision, so that is an alternative, of course. Personally, I prefer the menu system on Roku. I found the Fire TV menu to be cluttered with ads, and was always navigating around its Prime Video-centric bias. I love Prime Video but I didn\\\"t like being forced to always look at the Prime Video options first. Roku is a neutral displayer of viewing options. Another problem I had with the Fire TV Cube was keeping the audio in sync with the picture. At least twice a day I had to unplug the Cube to get the audio resynced. That trick always worked, but it was a nuisance. I did initially have a problem with audio sync on the 2020 Ultra, but I was able to correct it in Settings. The Ultra defaults to audio with \"Auto Detect\". I changed this Audio Setting to \"Auto Passthrough\" and that solved the problem. The biggest improvement in the Ultra 2020 is the remote. It features a sound control rocker with a mute button. It has voice search. It has four quick access apps: Hulu, Sling, Disney+, and Netflix. In addition, it has two programmable buttons, which I used for quick access to Prime Video and YouTube. The remote is capable of controlling both your TV and audio receiver IF both your TV and audio receiver have HDMI-CEC capabilities which are turned on. Most newer devices have HDMI-CEC, but be sure yours do if you expect the Roku remote to control your system. Compared to the Roku Streaming Stick+, which supports 4K and HDR, the Ultra has a wired LAN connection option in addition to a fast wifi with better range than previous Roku devices. Wired is always better if you have the capability. I also find that while the Ultra gets pretty warm, the Streaming Stick+ gets downright hot. Twice the Streaming Stick+ has displayed an \"overheat\" warning. That makes me nervous. Finally, the Roku devices, like the Fire TV Cube, can be controlled with Alexa. Just make sure you have downloaded the Roku Routine in the Alexa App and then run \"device search\" to add the 2020 Ultra. Punchline: the Roku Ultra 2020 is an excellent streaming device. The apps work faster and better than the apps within my LG SmartTV. The apps are also updated far more frequently than the ones installed on the TV. The Ultra 2020 is worth it provided you have or plan to buy a 4k TV which supports Dolby Vision and you also have a Dolby Atmos sound system. Otherwise, the Streaming Stick is half the price and almost as fast. The Fire TV options will be fine for you if you mostly watch Prime Video and are comfortable with the Fire TV menu system with all its ads."

            "top_reviews": "I bought several of these to replace multiple thermostats in my house. Installation was easy and everything seemed great until I started trying to set up schedules for each of my thermostats. Each time I would set a schedule on one thermostat in the Alexa app, that schedule would get applied to every thermostat. I spent over an hour discussing with support and was transferred to seven different Amazon product support representatives before one confirmed that this was the intended behavior and there were no plans to introduce the ability to have a unique schedule on each thermostat. If you have an upstairs and downstairs thermostat for example, they must run on the exact same schedule for home, away, and sleep. This doesn\\\"t really make sense in many cases, and makes these pretty much useless for me.  UPDATE 11/18/2021 Amazon has sent out a mass email stating that the scheduling issue I described above is a \"temporary app display issue\" that will be fixed in a future release of the Alexa app. Given that this directly contradicts the information a device support representative told me, and the fact that the support process was so painful, I am leaving my review at 1 star, but maybe at some point you will be able to set and see separate schedules per thermostat. I won\\\"t know as I have already returned mine."

ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 10, 2019: 5/5 stars UPDATED REVIEW: June 30, 2019: 3/5 stars (I docked down two stars for issues mentioned in UPDATE # 3 and # 4, and issues with parental controls).  For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (1 Kindle Touch, 1 Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and 1 Kindle 10). I also own two Amazon Fire tablets (Kindle 7 \u2013 2015: 5th generation and Kindle 8 \u2013 2018: 8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the \u201cSaving Money on Purchases\u201d section.)  This device is Amazon\u2019s most recently refreshed (2019 \u2013 9th generation) Fire 7 inch Kids Edition Tablet (henceforth referred to as Fire 7 KE) at an excellent price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are tough to beat, and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.  I have spent the past few days interacting with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.  -THE BOX: The Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet enclosed in the Amazon Kid-Proof case, a quick-start guide, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.  - AVAILABILITY: a Black tablet with Pink, Blue, or Purple cases with built-in-stand.  - Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 KE model: --- Display size remains the same --- PPI remains the same at 171 --- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM. --- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone) --- Size specifications stay the same --- Two-year service plan remains the same --- 1-year subscription to FreeTime Unlimited with automatic renewal at $2.99 per month plus tax. Individuals can cancel this subscription at any time by contacting Amazon Customer Service or the Amazon Parent Dashboard.  - Summary of critical aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7 Kids Edition: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017. --- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from the prior version. --- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging. --- The new processors: Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 1.3 GHz] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad Core ARM Cortex-A7 1.3 GHz] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available. --- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version. --- Slight increase in weight (2.3 oz/66 grams) though this item feels sturdier than the preceding model. --- New built-in stand (definitely a beneficial feature).  - Technical specs and other details: --- Size: 8.7\u201d x 6.3\u201d x 1.0\u201d (220 x 161 x 25.8 mm) --- 171 pixels per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles. --- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback --- Internal Storage: 16 GB --- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases. --- Weight: 16.1 ounces (456 grams) --- Warranty and Service: 2-year worry-free guarantee: if it breaks, return it, and we\"ll replace it for free (Amazon really doesn\u2019t ask any questions). The value of this feature cannot be overstated. A tablet in the hands of a child is subject to several drops. --- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera --- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor --- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life --- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used) --- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication. No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. --- Bluetooth 4.1 LE --- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker. --- Built-in microphone  - Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series): --- No HD video viewing available --- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out) --- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker) --- Sound quality is average --- Amazon\u2019s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store, but this is a nifty device nevertheless. --- Amazon\u2019s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.). --- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced). --- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.  *** Please note that this product is only for Ages 3 and up as there is a Choking Hazard with small parts.  - Comparison between Fire 7 KE (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 KE (2018 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Weight: Fire HD 8 (16.7 oz, 474 g) vs. Fire 7 (16.1 oz, 456 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 8 (32 GB) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB) --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point) --- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.  - Comparison between Fire 7 KE (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 KE (2017 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8) --- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera) --- Weight: Fire HD 10 (23.3 oz, 660 g) vs. Fire 7 (16.1 oz, 456 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 (32 GB) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB) --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Yellow cover option) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)  ** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10 KE, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).  - Some useful features on Fire KE Tablets (not a comprehensive list). Please note that parental controls can be used to block all of the below-listed features. --- Accessibility: \u201cVoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system-wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.\u201d --- Surfing the web using Amazon\u2019s web browser - Silk --- Watching movies, TV shows, and listening to music --- Ability to read Kindle books. --- Ability to read the news using Washington Times --- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon\u2019s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. --- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc. --- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store. * Basically, this can function as both an adult and a kid\u2019s tablet (older kids or adults can use it by disabling FreeTime).  - Amazon FreeTime Unlimited --- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over \u201c20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids\" profiles to give them more access to apps and games.\u201d \u201cIn FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.\u201d Another unique feature is Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish! Hopefully, there will be even more language options in the future to help bilingual or multilingual families and also to help those who wish to learn additional languages. --- Parents also have the option \u201cto set educational goals and curfews, and manage content for up to 4 child profiles with easy-to-use parental controls.\u201d This is really not as intuitive as it should be and can be frustrating to use. I have docked down a star as this has yet to be comprehensively developed. --- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers an unbeatable value \u2013 I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after the 1-year subscription expires). Additionally, kids can\u2019t make any additional purchases without parental authorization so it protects parents from liabilities. *FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations but it is pretty intuitive and outstanding. Amazon has done an outstanding job in this process. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time. This is a great feature, so you don\u2019t have to constantly follow your kid saying \u2013 \u201cyou have 5 more minutes before to turn the tablet off.\u201d The automatic turn-off absolves parents from this responsibility, avoids a potential meltdown, and teaches kids to be time conscious.  - Testing: Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.  - Saving money on purchasing the Fire Tablet Kids Edition --- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $99.99. --- Customers should also know that they can easily trade-in their prior Fire tablet for Amazon gift cards (for $5-$25 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire. --- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point. --- Sometimes Amazon provides bundle sales on products (get 2 or 3 items for a substantial discount). This is something for consumers to consider.  - Conclusion: To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, parental controls related limitations, and a basic app store. Updates worth noting in this version include a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable Kids tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and has access to several education apps, games, etc. then the Fire 7 KE tablet is the way to go.  - UPDATE # 1 and # 6: June 11, 2019 & June 21, 2019: Fire HD 8 Kids Edition + Echo Dot Kid Edition (release date June 26, 2019)  I recommend the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 KE (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars ($30 more). This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB RAM vs. 1 GB RAM), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I would personally get this tried and true model especially in light of Update # 3 (below).  --- Amazon recently offered a bundle sale to purchase both the Fire Kids Edition Tablet and Echo Dot Kids Edition (colors can be chosen). Fire 7 KE + Echo Dot KE: $129.98; Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE: $139.98; and Fire 10 HD KE + Echo Dot KE:$199.98. I recommend the Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE for $139.98. One FreeTime Unlimited subscription can function across multiple devices and the best way to maximize it is in my opinion to get both these devices. I will soon post a comprehensive review on the Echo Dot Kids Edition once the device becomes available, but cannot cover it here because I have exceeded Amazon\u2019s review space limitations.  - UPDATE # 2 (June 12, 2019): FreeTime Unlimited --- The age-specific apps/books/games on this device are not always age appropriate. Consequently, parents need to review every thing prior to letting children get these resources. These apps play a critical role in the formation of the child especially with screen time usage increasing at astounding rates (especially among children). --- This brings me to my second point of concern \u2013 screen time. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 18 months have no screen time with the exception of video-chatting while children 2-5 years should have no more than 1-hour per day of screen time (only high-quality programs) with parents co-viewing these videos with the child (parental interaction is key for formation of language skills and holistic development. Just watching educational videos is insufficient \u2013 kids learn by back and forth interaction with adults). They have additional guidelines for children 6 and older, which includes monitoring the child\u2019s media usage, providing strict guidelines for use of media, etc. I would strongly encourage parents to review this information prior to purchasing this media device.  - UPDATE # 3: June 13, 2019: Battery Life Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I did experience occasional fluctuations in battery life (nothing major) and so am docking down half a star. So, please bear this in mind when making the purchase.  UPDATE # 4 & # 5: June 14, 2019 & June 19, 2019: Toys Story Headphone *Customers that preordered the item were supposed to get a free Toys Story headphone ($25 value). However, I never received it. I purchased this item in spite of the sound quality and low volume issues because of the free headphones. However, since I didn\u2019t receive the headphones, I am docking down a star because the cost of getting a good-quality kid headphone ($24.99) added to the cost of the Fire 7 ($99.99) is equivalent ($124.98) to getting the better sound quality and volume Fire 8 KE ($129.99) with no headphones required and several other features. Amazon did contact me about this issue and asked how they could remedy the issue. They offered me $ 25 credit (headphone value) or a free headphone which I am grateful for. However, I still docked half a star because Amazon would not have contacted me if it was not for my review.  Please also note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.  Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review."

            "top_reviews": "I have a much better security camera system for my home\\\"s exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already. I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn\\\"t. None. Not a single thing.  It seems like common sense to me that they\\\"d integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I\\\"d be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.  I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn\\\"t in the house. Nope. There isn\\\"t even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you\\\"re home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn\\\"t either, so I suppose I should have known better already.  I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!  The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn\\\"t stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.  Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.  Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn\\\"t holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the \\\"battery saving options\\\" on. This was only a test as I don\\\"t actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I\\\"m home unless the alarm is armed or going off.  With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it\\\"s recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn\\\"t burning down.  Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it\\\"s other devices.  This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn\\\"t great but it never is on cameras of any kind.  ***UPDATE*** Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn\\\"t. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.  This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they\\\"ll add the other much needed features in the near future.  ***ANOTHER UPDATE*** From Ring Support: \"The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode\". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it\\\"s \\\"coming soon\\\" either way.  ***ONE MORE UPDATE*** Ring provided me early access to the \\\"Modes Feature\\\" and I\\\"ve been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven\\\"t told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released \\\"by the end of the year\\\".  I\\\"ve increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I\\\"ve now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.  ***LAST UPDATE*** Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I\\\"ve had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn\\\"t bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it\\\"s pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you\\\"re thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them."

            "top_reviews": "iPad is my go to device, other than my work computer. I use it for everything. From watching TV/Movies, to sketching to reading magazines, and everything else.  Background: I currently own 4 iPads (12.9 inch iPad Pro 2015, 12.9 inch iPad Pro 2021, iPad 2018, and now 2021 iPad 10.2) and have owned several others before, and a Surface Pro, a recent Surface Book, and 2 Kindle Fire tablets so I can say with confidence I am a tablet user. :-) Tablets are how I consume my content and though I\\\"ve given other devices a chance I keep coming back to iPads due to the intuitive interface and not having to worry about the device, and just enjoy my content.  Why I like this iPad 10.2 inch: Why did I get this one despite owning a 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 inch? This size of iPad is at the right price point and it has the right features, to make it my everywhere in the home, backyard, and travel companion. This is the one I don\\\"t have to worry about losing vs. my 2021 iPad Pro 1 TB that was just under $2K. The size makes it super convenient to carry around to read in a park or on the plane, do a quick FaceTime call while reading a recipe off it in the kitchen (the FT appears in a little window) and cooking. I love sketching on my iPad, and this 10.2 iPad though smaller than iPad Pro 12.9, feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro 12.9 inch is a magazine size (see photos for comparison of 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 with this iPad) and can be heavy to hold with one hand, I need to prop it up while sketching. I find the new iPad even more responsive to the Apple pencil, it\\\"s a joy to sketch on these or take quick notes during meetings, that then convert to text if I want. Though I LOVE my iPad Pro this one gets a lot of use due to the size and portability.  I like keeping this one on my recliner arm to browse around when I am next to the TV to find out more about the program I\\\"m watching, or to read a book in bed without worrying about dropping it on my face. The iPad Pro needs to be propped up, and once almost broke my nose when I got sleepy and it fell on my face! I also love looking at my photos that I take on the iPhone on my iPad as it\\\"s more immersive and so much easier to show someone than squinting at the phone. I usually keep the photos in iCloud due to the limit on storage on the device, and the iPad can just download them when I am viewing them. I also do craft work, and watching YouTube instruction videos and reading my crochet patterns is great on this size, it\\\"s just ready on the side of my sofa. I also drop it countless times (with case on) as it\\\"s sitting on the sofa arm, something I worry more about with the iPad Pro as it\\\"s bigger. I also like that this is the one device that still has a headphone jack, I own some sets of high end earbuds that use the traditional jack and it\\\"s great to be able to use them with it as the bluetooth buds need to be charged and sometimes I just want things to be simpler.  The 12 MP Front Camera on this 2021 version is great as FaceTime is so much clearer than my older version, I had to switch to my phone to FaceTime earlier due to the blurry video, but now I can do it right from the iPad. iOS 15 has all new features like Center Stage where the camera moves with the participant in a call, and that makes it so useful. I typically don\\\"t use a keyboard on my 10.2 iPad as I rarely type on it. I prefer doing that on my iPad Pro, but I\\\"ve tried this size with Belkin and Logitech keyboards and they worked really well. Although I could fold them back, I just didn\\\"t like the added weight as I did not use the keyboard often enough and once you put on that keyboard cover the advantages of a light tablet go away.  Overall, I would not really recommend upgrading if you have a recent iPad, but if you want to give your older iPad to a kid or your mom and get this one, go for it. However, I do recommend getting an iPad over other tablets. iOS 15 has unlocked even more features on it and it\\\"s super intuitive. It makes me happy to have a device where I can sketch at a moments notice, watch a show, or a craft video, edit my docs, write down my \"bright\" ideas with Apple pencil and have them convert to text, talk to my friends on video and oh yes, also listen to music, although I do that more on my phone. And it\\\"s the right size to carry in my purse, and I don\\\"t have to panic about dropping it or even losing it. Go ahead, you deserve it."

            "top_reviews": "This HP 24mh monitor has a clear, crisp display and is the perfect size for desktop use (not too big, not too small). It accepts both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs (and even VGA for old school PCs). While Windows will select 60Hz refresh rate by default, you can go into Windows\\\" display settings and select 75Hz refresh rate for this monitor. The 75Hz refresh rate really does help smooth out motion. You should also go into the monitor\\\"s \"Image\" menu setting and set Response Time to Level 3 which provides the best VSYNC performance. One of the best features that places this monitor above and beyond its price range is the 90-degree rotating screen, height adjustment, and swiveling base. The stand is rock-solid without any wobble. The speakers are just fine once you discover the menu control I explain below:  HOW TO FIX LOW VOLUME SOUND: The built-in speakers are better than some reviewers indicate. I believe most people don\\\"t discover that the monitor menu has its own volume control that\\\"s set to 50% volume by factory default. If you just connect this monitor to the PC you\\\"ll automatically get sound through the HP speakers via HDMI or DisplayPort (you only have to use the separate audio cable when using the VGA input). But no matter how high you turn up your PC volume control, you\\\"ll only get 50% volume from the monitor\\\"s speakers which is why people complain about low volume. To fix this, all you need to do is go to the \"Management\" tab of the monitor menu, select \"Audio\", and then turn up the volume control from 50 (default) to 100 and you\\\"ll find the monitor speakers are plenty loud. After that, you\\\"ll only have to use your PC volume control as normal.  This is a great quality monitor with features beyond its price range. Fantastic value, HP!  ADDITIONAL NOTE: HP sells an identical monitor to the HP 24mh under the model P24h. The only difference is that the P24h has a black plastic logo strip along the bottom instead of silver like the 24mh. Everything else is identical (specs, speakers, height adjustable stand, etc.) plus the P24h comes with both an HDMI cable and a DisplayPort cable."

Remember the days you\u2019d walk into a store and buy a power strip? You likely never paid attention to any specifications. But now times are different. Now we have access to the horror stories associated with every product under the sun, and we can compare the specifications of one power strip to another despite the fact that we have no idea what these differences really mean.

However, it seems that a machine is responsible (as should be expected) in making sure there are 100 zip ties of the same length in the bag. Here\\\"s where they are cheating. The first tie to come off of each roll was different, one 2\", another 4\", a third 5\", but not the 8\" promised on the package. At the end of the first roll there was another 3\" tie. So, there are several ties in the package that are not as advertised. Since there are three rolls in the package, this means that 6 ties are guaranteed to not be 8\". This may not seem like a big deal to you, but if you can imagine how much money that velcro pockets from each and every person that buys these with their false advertising, you can see how that isn\\\"t exactly a moral way to go.

I\\\"ve been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn\\\"t excite me.  I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.  So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I\\\"m super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it\\\"s a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn\\\"t need to use cloud storage and it\\\"s been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.  Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple \"indoor cams\" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It\\\"s been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option."

This device is Amazon\u2019s most recently refreshed (2019 \u2013 9th generation) Fire 7 inch Kids Edition Tablet (henceforth referred to as Fire 7 KE) at an excellent price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are tough to beat, and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.  I have spent the past few days interacting with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.  -THE BOX: The Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet enclosed in the Amazon Kid-Proof case, a quick-start guide, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.  - AVAILABILITY: a Black tablet with Pink, Blue, or Purple cases with built-in-stand.  - Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 KE model: --- Display size remains the same --- PPI remains the same at 171 --- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM. --- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone) --- Size specifications stay the same --- Two-year service plan remains the same --- 1-year subscription to FreeTime Unlimited with automatic renewal at $2.99 per month plus tax. Individuals can cancel this subscription at any time by contacting Amazon Customer Service or the Amazon Parent Dashboard.  - Summary of critical aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7 Kids Edition: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017. --- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from the prior version. --- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging. --- The new processors: Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 1.3 GHz] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad Core ARM Cortex-A7 1.3 GHz] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available. --- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version. --- Slight increase in weight (2.3 oz/66 grams) though this item feels sturdier than the preceding model. --- New built-in stand (definitely a beneficial feature).  - Technical specs and other details: --- Size: 8.7\u201d x 6.3\u201d x 1.0\u201d (220 x 161 x 25.8 mm) --- 171 pixels per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles. --- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback --- Internal Storage: 16 GB --- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases. --- Weight: 16.1 ounces (456 grams) --- Warranty and Service: 2-year worry-free guarantee: if it breaks, return it, and we\"ll replace it for free (Amazon really doesn\u2019t ask any questions). The value of this feature cannot be overstated. A tablet in the hands of a child is subject to several drops. --- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera --- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor --- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life --- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used) --- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication. No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. --- Bluetooth 4.1 LE --- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker. --- Built-in microphone  - Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series): --- No HD video viewing available --- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out) --- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker) --- Sound quality is average --- Amazon\u2019s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store, but this is a nifty device nevertheless. --- Amazon\u2019s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.). --- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced). --- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.  *** Please note that this product is only for Ages 3 and up as there is a Choking Hazard with small parts.  - Comparison between Fire 7 KE (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 KE (2018 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Weight: Fire HD 8 (16.7 oz, 474 g) vs. Fire 7 (16.1 oz, 456 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 8 (32 GB) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB) --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point) --- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.  - Comparison between Fire 7 KE (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 KE (2017 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8) --- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera) --- Weight: Fire HD 10 (23.3 oz, 660 g) vs. Fire 7 (16.1 oz, 456 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 (32 GB) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB) --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Yellow cover option) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)  ** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10 KE, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).  - Some useful features on Fire KE Tablets (not a comprehensive list). Please note that parental controls can be used to block all of the below-listed features. --- Accessibility: \u201cVoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system-wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.\u201d --- Surfing the web using Amazon\u2019s web browser - Silk --- Watching movies, TV shows, and listening to music --- Ability to read Kindle books. --- Ability to read the news using Washington Times --- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon\u2019s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. --- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc. --- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store. * Basically, this can function as both an adult and a kid\u2019s tablet (older kids or adults can use it by disabling FreeTime).  - Amazon FreeTime Unlimited --- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over \u201c20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids\" profiles to give them more access to apps and games.\u201d \u201cIn FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.\u201d Another unique feature is Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish! Hopefully, there will be even more language options in the future to help bilingual or multilingual families and also to help those who wish to learn additional languages. --- Parents also have the option \u201cto set educational goals and curfews, and manage content for up to 4 child profiles with easy-to-use parental controls.\u201d This is really not as intuitive as it should be and can be frustrating to use. I have docked down a star as this has yet to be comprehensively developed. --- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers an unbeatable value \u2013 I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after the 1-year subscription expires). Additionally, kids can\u2019t make any additional purchases without parental authorization so it protects parents from liabilities. *FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations but it is pretty intuitive and outstanding. Amazon has done an outstanding job in this process. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time. This is a great feature, so you don\u2019t have to constantly follow your kid saying \u2013 \u201cyou have 5 more minutes before to turn the tablet off.\u201d The automatic turn-off absolves parents from this responsibility, avoids a potential meltdown, and teaches kids to be time conscious.  - Testing: Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.  - Saving money on purchasing the Fire Tablet Kids Edition --- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $99.99. --- Customers should also know that they can easily trade-in their prior Fire tablet for Amazon gift cards (for $5-$25 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire. --- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point. --- Sometimes Amazon provides bundle sales on products (get 2 or 3 items for a substantial discount). This is something for consumers to consider.  - Conclusion: To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, parental controls related limitations, and a basic app store. Updates worth noting in this version include a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable Kids tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and has access to several education apps, games, etc. then the Fire 7 KE tablet is the way to go.  - UPDATE # 1 and # 6: June 11, 2019 & June 21, 2019: Fire HD 8 Kids Edition + Echo Dot Kid Edition (release date June 26, 2019)  I recommend the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 KE (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars ($30 more). This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB RAM vs. 1 GB RAM), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I would personally get this tried and true model especially in light of Update # 3 (below).  --- Amazon recently offered a bundle sale to purchase both the Fire Kids Edition Tablet and Echo Dot Kids Edition (colors can be chosen). Fire 7 KE + Echo Dot KE: $129.98; Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE: $139.98; and Fire 10 HD KE + Echo Dot KE:$199.98. I recommend the Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE for $139.98. One FreeTime Unlimited subscription can function across multiple devices and the best way to maximize it is in my opinion to get both these devices. I will soon post a comprehensive review on the Echo Dot Kids Edition once the device becomes available, but cannot cover it here because I have exceeded Amazon\u2019s review space limitations.  - UPDATE # 2 (June 12, 2019): FreeTime Unlimited --- The age-specific apps/books/games on this device are not always age appropriate. Consequently, parents need to review every thing prior to letting children get these resources. These apps play a critical role in the formation of the child especially with screen time usage increasing at astounding rates (especially among children). --- This brings me to my second point of concern \u2013 screen time. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 18 months have no screen time with the exception of video-chatting while children 2-5 years should have no more than 1-hour per day of screen time (only high-quality programs) with parents co-viewing these videos with the child (parental interaction is key for formation of language skills and holistic development. Just watching educational videos is insufficient \u2013 kids learn by back and forth interaction with adults). They have additional guidelines for children 6 and older, which includes monitoring the child\u2019s media usage, providing strict guidelines for use of media, etc. I would strongly encourage parents to review this information prior to purchasing this media device.  - UPDATE # 3: June 13, 2019: Battery Life Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I did experience occasional fluctuations in battery life (nothing major) and so am docking down half a star. So, please bear this in mind when making the purchase.  UPDATE # 4 & # 5: June 14, 2019 & June 19, 2019: Toys Story Headphone *Customers that preordered the item were supposed to get a free Toys Story headphone ($25 value). However, I never received it. I purchased this item in spite of the sound quality and low volume issues because of the free headphones. However, since I didn\u2019t receive the headphones, I am docking down a star because the cost of getting a good-quality kid headphone ($24.99) added to the cost of the Fire 7 ($99.99) is equivalent ($124.98) to getting the better sound quality and volume Fire 8 KE ($129.99) with no headphones required and several other features. Amazon did contact me about this issue and asked how they could remedy the issue. They offered me $ 25 credit (headphone value) or a free headphone which I am grateful for. However, I still docked half a star because Amazon would not have contacted me if it was not for my review.  Please also note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.  Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review."

ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 9, 2019 (5/5 stars) UPDATED REVIEW: June 21, 2019 (4/5 stars)  For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 \u2013 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 \u20138th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the \u201cSaving Money on Purchases\u201d section).  This device is Amazon\u2019s most recently refreshed (2019 \u2013 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.  Below is my summary of the \u201cFire 7.\u201d I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.  -THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.  - AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.  - Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model: --- Display size remains the same --- PPI remains the same at 171 --- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM. --- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone) --- Size specifications remain the same --- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)  - Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017. --- Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB). --- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version. --- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019).

I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging. --- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available. --- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version. --- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams) --- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page). --- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.  - Technical specs and other details: --- Size: 7.6\u201d x 4.5\u201d x 0.4\u201d (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm). --- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles. --- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback --- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB --- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases. --- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams --- Amazon\u2019s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for \u201cMashed Potatoes\u201d and it will do so. --- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7) --- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera --- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor --- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life --- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used) --- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication. No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. --- Bluetooth 4.1 LE --- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker.  - Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series): --- No HD video viewing available --- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out) --- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker) --- Sound quality is average --- Amazon\u2019s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store. --- Amazon\u2019s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.). --- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced). --- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.  -Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.  - Comparison between Fire 7 (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g) --- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point) --- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.  - Comparison between Fire 7 (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8) --- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera) --- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)] --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs..

VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.\u201d --- Surfing the web using Amazon\u2019s web browser - Silk --- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music. --- Ability to read Kindle books. --- Ability to read the news using Washington Times --- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon\u2019s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. --- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc. --- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.  - Testing: Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.  - Saving money on purchasing the Fire: --- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card. --- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet. --- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers.. --- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire. --- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item. --- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.  -Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).  - Conclusion: To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store. Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.  - UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8 I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).  - UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited - Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period) --- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over \u201c20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids\" profiles to give them more access to apps and games.\u201d \u201cIn FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.\u201d Another unique feature is Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish! --- Parents also have the option \u201cto set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.\u201d --- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value \u2013 I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends). *FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.  UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019): Battery Life and Software Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven\u2019t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.  Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.  Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!"

            "top_reviews": "Before ordering this one I already an echo show 8\u201d, first gen. I was about to buy another one when I got an add saying that I could pre-order a second gen. I could not find a good comparison anywhere so I asked myself, should I pay 20$ more for an unknown. I did and spoiler alert, it is worth it, kinda.  Positives:  - The new camera features are great. The camera can track you and center you for video calls, real time, and it does it accurately. - Speaking of the camera, the camera upgrade is insane. Went from 1MP to 13MP. - The processor is supposed to be much more powerful. Looking at the new camera features, understanding where you are in a group of people and tracking you accordingly, it is noticeable. However, given that a lot of the actions on the device are web based, there is not a huge difference on other apps. The responsiveness of the touchscreen is perhaps a bit better but it was good to begin with. - The unit will go to low power mode when idle, helping you save a penny here and there\u2026 - Several privacy features. The stop listening button we have grown used to. The camera can be manually closed shut for privacy. When remote viewing through the show, there is a warning message, etc...  Negatives:  - Amazon did not learn from their mistakes. Just like with the Show 10\u201d, the power cord is white for every unit, whether the unit is black or white. The camera shutter, is white too. - The 3.5 jack is gone.  Other thoughts:  The sound quality___  One of the items on my wish list for this one was an improved audio quality. The sound quality improved over the previous gen, I think, but I would say its marginal if that, not enough to even be sure it did.  The white cord___  What I hate the most about my Echo Show 10 is the white cord on a black unit. Since I fell for it with the Show 10 and white would go well with my decor, I preemptively went for a white unit, to eliminate the eyesore, in case Amazon did not learn from their mistakes. To a certain extent, I was secretly hoping the cord would be black so I could swap it with my Show 10\u201d and fix two problems with one move. Nope, its white.  Even with a warning from me that it could happen, a friend went for the charcoal one and he is still fuming. So, if you are like me that the white cord on a black unit would drive you crazy, and you are going for it, order the white one.  The environment___  If you are still on the fence about this one, be aware that 2nd gen uses recycled materials on its manufacturing. To me this is a selling point. _____________________________ TLDR, 1) If you use it a lot for video calls, the improved camera and improved camera features, makes it a worthy upgrade. If this is not your cup of tea, waiting for a prime day sale on a previous gen might be better. 2) If having a white cord on a black unit is something that would drive you crazy, get the white one or go for the previous gen."

            "top_reviews": "It makes two sizes of ice \"bullets\", small and large. It produced the first ice pieces in about 8 minutes. I found the small size pieces melt too quickly, so I prefer the \"large\" size. The instruction booklet is brief, but written in fairly good English. There was not much explanation of the cleaning cycle, which I ran first. It seems to run the clean cycle forever. I finally shut the power off to stop it. I decided to purchase this ice maker so I would not have to hire a plumber to run a line for a built in ice maker. Also, built in icemakers have a heater so the ice will separate from the freezing coils. After starting it up it did not need much time to fill a large bowl with ice to put in the freezer, but the bullets tend to freeze together into a solid clump in the freezer. I suppose if you put them in an ice bucket for a party or gathering they would be fine. You could take the icemaker with you to a gathering, but the instruction manual says to let is sit upright for 24 hours before using it. Apparently if this is not done the refrigerant in the small compressor may not be properly settled in its reservoir and the compressor could possibly be damaged as a result. So you would need to keep the icemaker in an upright position if you transport it or wait again 24 hours before using it. But I have no plans to be hauling it around. It will stay in operating position on a kitchen counter top. The main irritant is that the drain plug is on the bottom of the device and not as conveniently located as I would like, but that is not a deal breaker. The icemaker uses Isobutane as the refrigerant. Isobutane is flammable, but unless you do something idiotic and pierce the coolant lines that should never be a problem. This is very clearly disclosed in the instructions. It is fairly common for small chest type freezers or portable icemakers to use isobutane or some other flammable hydrocarbon as the refrigerant.  Overall, it appears to be of good quality, well made, works as claimed, and suits my needs."

            "top_reviews": "We are always running out of ice and this has solved the problem. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago.  This ice maker is excellent and will delivery the 26 lbs. of ice per day. What a lot of people don\"t understand about countertop ice makers is that when the ice is made it is about 27 degrees and the ice maker is not a storage freezer. Think of it like the ice that was just made will sit in the ice maker which is like keeping ice in a cooler. It won\"t get colder it will just slowly melt and then gets turned back into ice again.  Keep in mind when you pull ice out of your kitchen freezer that has been in there for several hours it is around 0 degrees vs. the 27 degrees right out of the countertop ice maker. So, ice from your freezer is going to last a lot longer in a drink than ice out of this countertop ice maker. So, that may not be ideal for some if you are having a drink outside on a hot day and not using an insulated cup. For best results take the ice out of the countertop ice maker and put it in a gallon ziplock bag and place it in the freezer for a little while so it will get down to the 0 degrees. That is not necessary though. The ice that comes right out of the machine is plenty cold enough for drinking beverages indoors. If you want to use the ice outdoors just place the ice in an insulated cup.  Pros: Very quality built machine. Very easy to use. It uses lights to notify you of the status rather than annoying beeps. It really does make 26 lbs. of ice in an hour. First ice in about 8 minutes. Full basket of ice in about an hour. Pauses itself when ice basket is full and will resume ice production automatically as soon as some ice is removed. Light comes on when water needs to be added (keep in mind you still have a full basket of ice when this triggers). Melts very slowly and if you leave it on over night it only comes on once or twice to replace the ice that melted. Quite operation. It doesn\"t take up a lot of countertop space so we are able to leave it out and it matches our stainless steel fridge. It comes with a nice ice scoop which is great for parties. This ice maker keeps dropping ice every 8 minutes. The cord is very long so it doesn\"t have to be right up against the outlet.  Cons: The only con I have about the machine is trying to drain the water remaining when you are done using it. There is a drain plug underneath it that is a little tricky to use because you can\"t see underneath the machine and you can\"t just turn the machine upside down to drain it per their instructions. That will harm the machine.  What I found to be a great solution is instead of using the drain plug I use a microfiber towel to soak up all the water left in the machine. That only takes a quick second and you don\"t have to move the ice maker over the sink to drain it. I then leave the lid open to make sure it dries out. So it really isn\"t a con if you use the microfiber towel. It is so easy this way which means I never mind using the machine even to make a small amount of ice."

Independently I learned about \\\"ambient temperature.\\\" This would be very important as other reviewers said \"motor died\" after short time. I called the manufacturer to ask about \"ambient temperature.\\\" She didn\\\"t know, but would ask supervisor. Got my answer & stayed with my intention of keeping it in the house. If the placement location temperature is between 50 & 100 degrees, it will work fine. If it goes under or over, for a while, then the motor will work too hard to keep at your setting & die. It can\\\"t take those temperatures. Garages or sheds, unless insulated get too hot (So. Calif.), other areas it might be too cold. I hope you learned something from my efforts. Keep my fingers crossed and the motor is not defective, no matter where I put it. Also no power light to let you know it\\\"s on and no inside light but that\\\"s OK. Bought a little hanging freezer thermometer. Oh, yes it\\\"s VERY quiet."

I was hesitant to use for a couple days while the refrigerant settled and compressor stabilized during transport because it gave me time to read the \"Refrigerant could explode\" claims too many times.  With room temp water, and I strongly suggest using a filter like zero water, it takes about 8 min for your first batch of 8 cylindrical ice nuggets to be made. Even on large ice you\\\"ll need a few cycles for that first drink. Nuggets are frozen, but barely. Noise level is very low during the freezing cycles but it\\\"s very loud when it drops them into a tray to be mechanically shoveled into the smallish bin. My dog hates the noise it makes during the collection cycle. You\\\"ll get 3-4 full ice bins to every water fill. Ice melts back into water reservoir to be recycled. It stops when it\\\"s full, IR sensor beam broken, and starts up again when the IR sensor path is unbroken again (ex. Ice melts). I let it run continuously and it will always have a full bin and the ice making process gets down to 4-5 min. A full bin is suitable for 4-5 8oz glasses of ice.  Worth every penny but it\\\"s not a solid 5 star."

Look at the old unit to find which one to remove 6: hang unit by four screws in corner (see my photo) 7: hook wiring up just like your old one, white to white, black to black, etc. 8. Screw wiring cover in place with one black screw 9: installold light bulb (I used the one from my old unit. 10: turn power on and test unit, both fan and light. 11: step back and marvel at how much money you saved by doing it yourself, and revel in the praise from your spouse or significant other.  This might seem intimidating but it was easy. One didn\"t come with a light bulb so get one on hand. The filter mine came with seemed nicer than others, it had a metal front and blue filter material on the back. The fan isn\"t super strong but I bought this for looks mostly.

The unit has a thermostat or timer that turns the burner completely off. It remains off for too long. Which means if you are using this for anything more than heating a single 15 ounce can of some kind of food, you will be disappointed. Don\"t use this for cooking. Use it for heating something that only takes five or so minutes.  I use this burner with a 2 liter pressure cooker for cooking rice. It also has been used to cook spaghetti. I also use it with a smaller 1.5 liter pot to heat canned foods. While cooking spaghetti for one person, it will boil the water. A minute or so after the spaghetti is put into the pot, it will turn off for a minute. Just as the water boil is ending it will come on again. If this were a big pot it would never keep enough constant heat going to cook anything over a long period.  It works for rice because I use a pressure cooker. It will boil two cups of water and cause the pressure rocker to move at full pressure. Once that pressure is reached, the burner is turned off and the pot only needs to sit for half an hour to finish cooking the rice. Without a pressure cooker, I don\"t know if the temperature would be kept hot enough for a longer period of time to cook the rice properly.  This works for heating things that are small. Don\"t buy this if you intend to cook anything that takes more than five minutes of constant heat."

            "top_reviews": "I am giving this a 4 star rating since it takes some work prior, and a long freezing time to make 2 crystal clear ice balls. It took me many tries to achieve the desired results; as the instructions included where not very informative. The ice balls would have some cloudy areas and would not be a full ball / have concave areas.  It might be because of the water I used, or how my freezer works. The crystal clear balls I get now are completely full / have a small nipple like bump on each end with a fine ridge around the sides of the ball. (These can be removed for a completely smooth ball by gently rubbing those areas again the inside of a stainless steel pan. Personally after many tries to achieve this, I am fine with the more rustic / erotic look they have.)  To achieve these results I use bottled spring water, then... 1. Bring 34oz (about 4 -1/4 cups) of water to a full rolling boil, and then continue boiling for 1 minute. 2. Remove from heat and wait till bubbling stops. Then fill the bottom portion of the unit with the hot water up to the fill line. (Reserving remaining water to top off.) 3. Slowly insert / lower the silicon mold into the bottom portion until it stops. Use some of the remaining water to completely fill the 2 rectangular areas on the top of the mold. 4. Leave this on your counter for 36 minutes. (This will help warm the unit completely to help with the top to bottom freezing method needed to make clear ice.) 5. Use remaining water to fill the top rectangular areas of the mold completely. (Usually at the 15 minute mark of the wait time, and just before placing the unit in the freezer.) 6. Freeze for about 27-1/2 to 28 hours. 7. Remove from freezer and gently tug on one side of the mold, then the other to remove the mold / crystal clear ice balls. 8. Store ice balls in a gallon size, slide closing plastic freezer bag. (Holds more balls & is easier to open and close than the bag provided.)  These ice balls look amazing in whatever type of drink you are serving that requires ice. They have a long melting time. While they do melt you do not get the diluted drink flavor as quickly / as strongly as when using square ice cubes."

They describe it as a \"dishwasher and washing machine.\" I\\\"ve used several items like this or very similar. This one seems fairly sturdy and functions as described (I\\\"ve used this one once so far.) I\\\"ve used these types of washing items for washing small, lightweight clothing as well as similar item to wash dishes. For small lightweight clothing it functions the way a standard washing machine does as it agitates the clothing and water. The difference is that you have to do the rest such as rinsing and wringing out. This item has several modes. Automatic (goes through all cycles), agitate only, (rotates), ultrasonic vibration only (used in some dishwashing items) and bubbles only. For small lightweight clothing, the agitating works great. When I use as a dishwasher, I sometimes use automatic (but since it doesn\\\"t have a fan guard, sometimes the dishes bump into the rotation.) I also use the ultrasonic vibration alone for dish washing with soapy water. While this doesn\\\"t clean like a standard dishwashing unit costing hundreds of dollars, I think of it like I\\\"m soaking the dishes in a \"super soaking\" mode. This allows me time to do other things in the kitchen while the dishes are getting fairly clean. I\\\"ve also noticed similar items that are advertised as \"portable sink dishwashers\" that only have the ultrasonic vibration feature and sells for more than double. So for me, this is fairly priced and seems to do a decent job."

This is model EFRF694 and I tried numerous times to register it on Frigidaire\u2019s website, but they don\u2019t recognize the model when trying to enter it. So, put the burden on the extended warranty company should a problem arise.  Delivery seemed OK, but upon unboxing it, the top rear black vented bracket was damaged. Assessing the damage and that the purpose of the plastic bracket is to keep from placing the freezer to close to the back wall, I decided not to return it IF the freezer operated as expected.  Before plugging it it, I let it sit upright for a few hours so in case it had been on its side prior to receiving it, the refrigerant would return to its correct orientation.  Level in its intended space, I plugged it in with a freezer thermometer inside and checked the temp after 25 minutes... 10 degrees. After 1 hour, 0 degrees. Later I loaded the freezer with meats & other frozen items (nice inside space - much easier to organize than a chest type freezer where it\u2019s hard to see/find). After around 9-10 hours, the inside temperature is minus 5 degrees.  Aside from the rear damage I mentioned, I have now noticed a very small ding in the front door. Both the rear damage and front door ding obviously occurred during shipping... One very obvious and the other not do much. The shipping box is cardboard and certainly not thick enough. There was styrofoam protection on each corner, but thin and obviously designed to steady the freezer in shipment as were top & bottom styrofoam pieces. Not good enough to protect the freezer during normal handling and certainly not good enough if shipping gets a little rough.  So 2 Things To Remember: 1 - Get the extended warranty - No apparent way to register it with Frigidaire*** 2 - There may be some shipping damage & you\u2019ll need to decide If you want to keep the freezer or return it. If it works well and you can live with the appearance, keep it as the replacement may be much worse.  ***From what I can determine reading the included manual, I believe this freezer was manufactured in Canada"

            "top_reviews": "I decided to purchase this one. The height is maybe one inch off from the dimensions listed, so make sure you account for that if you want this to go under a cabinet or something. I purchased this one because of the options. I did not want to have to fiddle with finding attachments to fit my weird sink and I also wanted to still be able to have use of my kitchen sink while I was washing dishes. This one comes with both options. If you choose to plumb it into your sink it has the attachments. If you\"re like me, then it comes with a jug that you can use to fill the reservoir inside. It takes about 3 or 4 jugs full of cold water (the unit heats the water itself so no need to waste hot water) to fill. The manual was easy to figure out despite a few typos. The unit was basically ready to use out of the box! I did have the slightest bit of cosmetic damage to my unit, probably happened in transit. Nothing too crazy but a small hairline crack in the plastic on one of the corners. It does not affect the operation of the dishwasher. I did a trial run last night to see how effectively it took off some dried gravy on a plate. Most of the gravy came off. I also loaded it with other dishes that were mostly rinsed clean, some with a little tiny bit of spaghetti sauce, etc. I will say it is comparable to a normal sized dishwasher, just like the big ones you still need to make sure you rinse your dishes fairly well before loading it up. The dishes came out really clean. I am really impressed. Even the one half rinsed dish that had a little bit of gravy left on it. If you\"re like me, and you live in a small apartment (mines only about 560 sq ft.) and you HATE DISHESSSS because your sink is so small that you can\"t even cook one meal without the kitchen looking like a disaster, then this thing is definitely worth the money. I have run it 2 more times since getting it. I really like it a lot and it seems like it will last a long time. Seems fairly sturdy in construction. I use Cascade powder. It is perfect for one or two people, or for a mini dishwasher in a bar area or boat, man cave, rv, anything like that. I would say it is especially useful in a personal bar, my glasses have come out sparkling clean. The utensil tray is removable to fit dinner plates. I will try to come back and update this review if anything happens, but I am really impressed so far. It\"s fairly quiet, sounds like a regular ol dishwasher to me lol. I hope this helps!  Update: We still use it multiple times per week and it has held up wonderfully! Buy this thing! I am able to fit most things in except for a few pieces I own. Gosh I love my dishwasher so much~  Updated update: The thing is still working wonderfully. Still love my little dishwasher!  Updated update to the update (12/21/21): the racks are starting to rust but the thing is still kicking and does a great job. I might have to contact the manufacturer about purchasing a possible rack replacement. I love this thing still so much. Yes I could just do the dishes sometimes and it may even be faster but I really like how it dries them and gets really hot and sanitizes the dishes. It\"s a great little thing. The hairline crack I mentioned before has spread a little more but it\"s still 100% functioning."

Several hours later, 3 loads later, I\u2019m very happy. The directions suck because you think the machine is broken after following the steps, but they don\u2019t tell you this... 1. First you need to make sure the gray drain hose is not laying low on the ground like hanging on the bathtub or on floor of the shower. You must hang it on your sink so tube is going up. If you don\u2019t when you try to fill the machine with water you will see it does not fill, it just drains right out the gray tube. Yup stood there watching it just go in and out. 2. When you select normal wash, you can not select the wash button, rinse button or spin button! It\u2019s is already preset. Those buttons only work when you select Heavy wash. I thought my machine was broken cause I tried pressing them and nothing happened. 3. The door must be closed. If you have to open it, press the pause button first. Then close and press play 4. The water fills, then the water agitates for 3 minutes. THEN IT STOPS for a whole 2 minutes, then it agitates for 3 minutes, then it stops... and it goes like this. It\u2019s not broken so be patient. This thing spins dry SO WELL! Nothing came out wet. 41 minute normal cycle. Looks small but fit enough clothes for me. First load I was able to fit 5 pair of dickies scrub pants (xs) Second load 3 short sleeve scrub tops (xs) 5 pairs tube sock, cooking apron and 3 panties. Third load 1 men\u2019s medium sweat pants, 1 small long sleeve button down shirt, 1 cooking apron, 3 kitchen towels."

            "top_reviews": "I recently replaced our bullet icemaker that failed after about a year of steady use, with this machine, and I am quite happy with the change.  PROS: The new ice is clear, lasts much longer than the bullet ice, and has a higher capacity for both ice and water. The icemaking cycle is fairly quick and you can adjust the time in 1 minute increments either longer (for thicker ice), or shorter (for smaller cubes). I set mine for -2 minutes which give perfectly acceptable square cubes with slight indentations. This ice is much better than bullet ice. Scooping the ice out is fairly easy because of the wide opening when you lift the lid, and the separate water reservoir makes filling easier than the old bullet machine.  CONS: The one significant negative is that the shutoff mechanism for detecting when the bucket is full of ice doesnt always work and this leads to a thick slab of ice getting stuck in the freezing tray. When this happens you have to manually activate the tray heating/release (hold the on/off button down for 5 seconds) and, sometimes if the ice is too thick, actually pry it out of the freezing tray. This happens frequently enough to be annoying (a couple of times a week with continuous use) but I still recommend the machine. The old bullet icemaker used a photodiode to detect a full bucket which worked reasonably well. This machine uses a mechanical system with ice falling out of the tray onto a little paddle switch in front of the tray, depressing it, and staying there (which happens if the bucket is full and the ice cant fall into it). But a piece of ice can easily get stuck under the paddle and then the system doesnt work and it just keeps trying to make ice - not great engineering. Some of the reviews mentioned noise, but it hasnt been a problem for me.  ACCESSORIES: Because the ice generally comes out of the tray with the cubes connected, you should get a heavier scoop to break it up (especially the thick slabs that form when the shutoff doesnt work). The machine comes with a little plastic one but you\"ll probably want/need something better. I got this one and am pretty happy with it. LIANYU Ice Scoop, Stainless Steel Ice Scooper, Food Candy Popcorn Sugar Scoop, Flat Bottom, Heavy Duty, Mirror Finish - 8 Oz  SUMMARY: So the quick summary is, great ice, good capacity, fairly fast, but bad ice-full detection. I\"ll update on reliability and cleaning when I\"ve had it longer."

We purchased this copper colored Frigidaire unit and we notice it is quieter and makes ice faster than the first model. There have definitely been design improvements.  This unit keeps up with the rate we drink ice water, which is pretty much constantly. The unit has two speed settings. The faster setting makes a softer chewable ice which my wife prefers. I\u2019m indifferent to that, but we both love the hollow shape of the ice (tubes, not cubes) because the increased surface area chills a drink faster. We also like the ease of walking over to the countertop unit to add ice to the sane glass periodically. It\u2019s effortless.  The ice is just as fresh as the water you use, because there are no refrigerated food odors absorbed into the standing ice.  The unit will accumulate residue over time and it does require cleaning which can be difficult unless you buy a long handled brush to reach inside and clean the mechanism.

The other main feature that we wanted was a hood that doesn\"t have an open space that shows the fan and all the other inner mechanical parts of the hood. This hood has steel mesh grease filters that fit flush along the bottom of the hood and thus they hide everything and give the unit a clean, professional appearance even when standing under the hood. We also purchased the required charcoal filters needed to use this hood ductless. The charcoal filters attach to the top of the grease filters so they do not detract from the sleek look. Wiring is also very simple. This hood only requires the standard 3 wires that you connect to your home wiring. Black, White and Green for the ground. It also comes with the screws needed to mount the unit below your cabinet. We have 12-inch cabinets and it fit like a glove. Our cabinets have a recessed bottom, so we did have to attach wood shims to the bottom of our cabinet before mounting the hood. The pre-installed lights are plenty bright and the fan runs very quietly, even on high speed. For these reasons, we are very satisfied with this hood and would buy it again."

Everything was going along very well\u2014the Broan hood was virtually a perfect fit under our cabinets where the old hood was removed from, and my husband installed it quite easily. We stood back to gaze upon the beauty only to realize we still needed to remove the blue plastic protective strip that was on the very front of the unit. I peeled it off only to discover several scratches in the black paint. How they got UNDER the protective strip is a mystery as the shipping box was in excellent condition showing no signs of brutal treatment from UPS, and the strip itself had no nicks or holes in it to indicate damage after the strip had been applied. We could only come to the conclusion that the fan was scratched by the manufacturer but rather than scrap it or repair the damage, they covered it up with the protective blue strip and put it on the market anyway. Since the hood was fully installed when we found the damage, we were hardly in the mood for removing it, packing it up, and shipping it back to Amazon. I took a black Sharpie and filled the scratches in the best I could, and really unless you are right up close and looking for them, the scratches are much less noticeable. Moral of this story is that it might be best to remove that blue strip before installation so that you can find any possible damage before it is installed and return it if you so choose. The fan itself is very quiet on the low setting, somewhat noisy on the high setting; suction seems adequate but not stellar which I didn\u2019t expect anyway considering the price point. The hood can accept up to a 75w bulb, and we put in an LED bulb that gives off plenty of bright white light but doesn\u2019t get hot enough to melt the plastic shield that covers the bulb. If it weren\u2019t for the scratches in the unit, I would have given 5 stars."

However I don\"t think it should be an issue as opening the door doesn\"t put a lot of pressure on them. I would prefer chrome but it wasn\"t a deal breaker for me. 2. There\"s no fan cooling the compressor on the back. My guess is it\"s because this is a narrower model 28 in vs. average 30 in. My old fridge had a fan but it was 30 in wide. 3. It is very quiet. 4. The freezer has a cold and colder temp adjustment. I set mine on cold and it was enough to keep food frozen. 5. Just to be on a safe sight I didn\"t plug it in for 24 hrs to allow coolant to set as I didn\"t know how it was stored in the warehouse or on the delivery truck (it should be stored upright). 6. The fridge uses R600 coolant as opposed to R134 freon. It is more environmentally friendly but it is flammable (freon is not). It looks like R600 is replacing freon though the 1st night I had nightmares about the fridge exploding. I used to keep a toaster oven on top of the old one, but will not on top of this one. The flammable coolant is the reason for 4 stars. 7. The instructions asked for removing a plastic film from a drain plug, but I think it applies to self defrosting models, not the manual defrosting one like this. I couldn\"t find a drain plug anywhere inside the fridge."

They were in MP4 format. So I called customer and got a whirlwind of agents that border on incompetent claiming they \"knew\" but did not. They had me do a reset wiping out all I already had downloaded from previous tablet. That did NOTHING, same issue. Next agent told me that I could ONLY use one of two \"approved\" SD\\\"s,which I knew was untrue from a latter agent. Then I get an email from unknown customer agent that the SD\\\"s had to be formatted only FAT32 not exFat32 which is in direct contradiction to the tablet help files. So on and on with numerous calls with some \"pretending\" to be advanced Tech support but did not know about formatting in FAT32 or other from9 am until late at night. One was supposed to call back in 20 minutes did not. Another when I asked what country they were calling from ( asked because of the time zone difference) said that was rude and just hung up the phone.  Now I find out it is supposed to be a Generation 11 2021 table but when you look in the \"about Tablet\" in the Setting it states Gen 10. You also cannot use the \"Play Store\" but only their App Store keeping it Proprietary like computers did 40 years ago. And it is not really a true Android.  All in all this tablet is not worth the trouble unless you just content with Amazon shopping and Prime watching. After a supervisor is \"supposed\"to call me back June 2 ( three days) and see if they resolved the MP4 SD issue I will return it unless resolved. I have 17 - 32 gb SD\\\"s each with 30+ movies on each (510) I have been watching on my previous Fire Tablet. I will be darned if I am going to save all those, reformat the disk, and reinstall them on the disk for a crappy new Fire tablet and worse customer Service for it.  UPDATE:!!! Well the supervisor that was supposed to call me never has. So I called and got another\"Expert\" that has done exactly the same thing all the rest did and was going to send me another tablet until I seen in the reviews that others have had the same issues. You cannot use this tablet unless you format the SD in their machine and then transfer whatever you want to put on it.  Now do want to even return my \"Gift Card\" I applied to this order. So they want to keep my old table, keep my gift card. And I have to drive 35 miles to return this shitty table.  HERE IS THE AMAZON CON. THEY DID AN \"UPDATE\" AND CHANGED THE WORDS GENERATION 10 TO \"TABLET 10 (11TH GENERATION)\" AND NOW THEY WANT TO KEEP MY OLD TABLET AND THE $30 CREDIT FOR SENDING IT IN ."

In my video review, I used a type-c PD charger that delivers 14.12 watts of power when the tablet is around 68% battery. With the included charger, it was only able to deliver 5 watts. I won\u2019t be surprised it can be charged from 0 to 100% under 3 hours!  - Storage: It supports 1TB of additional storage! I I bought the 32GB version, put in 64GB SD card and plan to get a larger one in the future for movie storage.  - Capable of enabling Alexa, with on/off toggle. It works but I don\"t use Alexa much."

            "top_reviews": "This is my third Kindle Fire device. I had the HDX for years then gifted it to my son. I then ordered the 8 Plus most recently and have generally enjoyed it. However, as someone that has a giant phone with me, I came to realize that the screen just wasn\u2019t big enough to justify using it regularly. Enter the new HD 10 Plus with its larger screen. My assumption was that, for the most part, this would basically be a larger version the 8. Generally, my assumption was correct but Amazon did a very nice job of tweaking some areas that desperately needed it. I will detail some of those tweaks here but, at its core, this tablet is still very much just a very reasonably priced entertainment device. I think some folks misunderstand the intent from Amazon here. The Fire line up is designed to meet the demands of most tablet owner\u2019s needs; streaming music, streaming Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix, handling emails, general web browsing and more. I know, Amazon is offering a \u201cproductivity bundle\u201d here and it is nice to see Amazon trying to make these more flexible but, make no mistake, there is a reason that companies like Apple and Samsung charge so much more for their devices. However, if you aren\u2019t expecting an iPad like experience, I think most folks should be genuinely happy with the HD 10 Plus. It does an awful lot incredibly well! Here is the breakdown:  -The Screen: One of my biggest complaints about the Fire 8 Plus was the screen. It felt dull and lifeless to me. Functional and fine for a movie or bopping around online indoors but not a vibrant experience. Part of the issue is, so many of us have phones with these crazy perfect panels on them now. HD+, FHD+, WQHD+, and more! Plus, some of have adaptive refresh rates. I mean these screens are amazing today! These phones often cost over $1,000. So, for devices that retail at less than $250, it would not be fair to expect that level of screen quality. That being said, Amazon has definitely improved things here. We get 1080p HD and the screen does not feel as laggy or slow to me. Further, it is noticeably brighter to my eyes which was probably my single biggest complaint about the 8. You will not want to try and stream a show on a bright day on the beach, but it just looks and performs better overall. Combined now with the bigger screen size and I think this panel might actually be a strength of the new 10. Well done!  -Form Factor: I loved the Fire 8 Plus with one big nitpick: GIGANTIC bezels! This 10 still has big ones but they feel so much smaller to me. Good stuff. The device feels good in the hand. Solid! Amazon claims a twelve-hour battery. I am seeing at least that. This thing is a beast with battery life!! Charging is handled via USBC or wireless. There is an included 9W brick but make sure to find a 15W brick as that is this tablet\u2019s max charging capability. You will see much faster speeds. I have not had to recharge yet but figure around three hours. As with the last gen 8 Plus the wireless charging was a great inclusion at this price Amazon! With 4GB of RAM and a slightly upgraded RealTek processor, I was expecting this to be faster and smoother. Frankly, I am just not sure. Maybe a little bit. It handles everything I have thrown at it. It is a marginal improvement over the last 8 Plus in this regard. If you were hoping for huge speed and performance upgrades over the 8 Plus, do not bother here. It is smoother but it is somewhat negligible. Amazon is claiming almost 2x the durability in drop testing over the latest iPad 10.2 with significantly strengthened glass. Time will tell on that, but this is good news. Additionally, like the 8 Plus, this can be dropped in Amazon\u2019s $50 wireless dock and it will basically become an Echo Show. Pretty slick! I opted for the 64GB model (there is also 32GB) but you can add up to 1TB via expandable memory. Unlike many others, Amazon still supports a good old-fashioned 3.5mm stereo jack. There is a 2MP front-facing camera and a 5MP rear camera that shoots up to 720p video. If you have a smartphone built in the last 4 years, you will want to skip anything but, perhaps, a Zoom meeting. The cameras produce below average images by today\u2019s standards. This is an okay place to make a save in my opinion. The speakers here are improved over the 8 Plus but are still just average.  -Connectivity: You get 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz WiFi here for networking and Bluetooth 5.0 LE. In my experience so far, I have had very stable WiFi connection to my home network with solid range. Additionally, as I would expect with this version of Bluetooth, my connection to my ear buds has been strong and can get 50\u2019 plus of range.  -Other Important Thoughts: I cannot find any codec support from either Amazon or Realtek. I did not anticipate that here. Despite that, I see very little latency when streaming video. Know though that, when streaming music services, do not bother with cranking up the stream quality. This device will not handle anything but fairly compressed audio. Fine in a pinch but an iPhone with AAC or an Android with AptX (at a minimum) will sound better. Amazon does let you go to split screen here to take advantage of the bigger real estate. I do not anticipate using it but you could watch a video on Netflix and answer emails at the same time. Might be handy to some. You will hear grumbling about the Amazon app store in some of the reviews. It happens every time they release a new device. As a long time Fire tablet and Android user, I will say that I have never understood Amazon\u2019s decision here. Just so much work for a substandard result! That said, I doubt too many of you will find many apps missing. Amazon has given us access to all the big-name apps here. There might be some niche missing stuff but 98% of consumers will likely be pleased here. If you are wondering whether to pay for ad removal or not, I always go for the ads. Only on my reading Kindle\u2019s have I paid to remove them. It is not expensive to remove them, but they are only on the lock screen. I swipe the screen and they disappear. Inconsequential to me but, if they bother you, you can pay any time (even after purchase) to remove them so, if you are a first time Fire buyer, I recommend taking the save initially to see how you feel about them. Also, plan on buying the Amazon brand case. It has a premium feel and protects the tablet nicely. It also offers a unique approach to standing the device both in portrait and landscape modes. Well done.  Conclusion: So, I need to spend more time here and will update as I go but, given the similarities to the 8 Plus, I am confident in my early recommendation. In comparison, I just cannot tell you guys what a difference the size difference makes. Between the smaller bezels and the increased screen size, this feels like a completely different device. The bigger brighter screen just makes consuming all forms of media a much better experience. I did not opt for the \u201cProductivity Package\u201d because, candidly, I just cannot see using this device for work stuff. The point of Fire devices, at least for me, is to just have an inexpensive entertainment machine. Again, I hate to dismiss the idea without trying it but I just do not think a RealTek processor is capable of creating a really robust experience for work and it doesn\u2019t matter how many free Microsoft apps you get thrown into the deal. At just over $200, I am perfectly fine with this. I embrace what Amazon has created here. One other important note: If you have an old Fire device, like the HDX lying around, Amazon gives you 20% off here and $15 for the device, assuming it is still operational. That was a $60 savings for me which is much more than the device was worth. The HD 10 Plus is a well-made high value device that makes entertainment on the fly easy. Whether you want to watch something on Amazon or HBO, do some gaming, fire off some emails, or just surf around the net, this 10.1\u201d Fire tablet will put a smile on your face. I will update this review as I go here but, at least for me, this is an easy recommendation. Nice work to the Amazon team here yet again!  *Update* So it has been over a week and I am more pleased than I was initially. This is exactly what I wanted. The screen is really good. I no longer miss my S21 Ultra when watching video during my elliptical sessions. It is also snappier than I thought initially. Moving around the tablet and interacting with various apps feels more responsive than the last 8 to me for sure. Amazon does include the AAC codec here so Apple users will have optimized audio when listening to music. I finally found that information. All and all, for the price, I continue to be amazed. Will update further but buy with complete confidence."

I really appreciate that they look nice because I\"m using them as gifts for my students and if it were if I were reviewing them purely on how they look I would happily give them 5 stars. However, I had to sort through the entire bag carefully because there were definitely some inappropriate stickers in there, despite the fact that they\"re labeled kid friendly classroom friendly all of that. There were curse words and slurs; you can see in my photo that these were the 5 biggest offenders. I pulled a couple others out just because I didn\"t think they were appropriate for elementary school but if you were teaching junior high they probably fine. However I feel like these 5 that I pulled out wouldn\"t be appropriate for a teacher to give a student in any K through 12 setting. Because of that I had to bring down a few stars because it\"s just more work know, you have to sort through all of them. So bottom line, would I buy them again? Yes. I totally would. But be prepared to sort through because there are going to be some inappropriate stickers."

They quote you $10 for the 8th Gen and when you mail it in they say that it didn\"t meet standards and reduce the amount to $5 and charge you the extra $5. I don\"t know how mine didn\"t meet the standards. It had a screen protector since day 1 and a case. No scratches, not blemishes, full charge, wiped as ordered. This seems to not meet their standards. I have been hosed on their trade in program before trading in a Echo 1st Gen so you would think I would have learned my lesson. Amazon gives you a joke of a trade in and then they cut that joke in half or all together and expect you to just grin and bare it.  BE WARNED, DO NOT USE THE TRADE IN PROGRAM. While I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon I will never promote their trade in program and I will voice my opinion anytime someone is thinking of using it. Shame on you Amazon."

What I liked about this product is that it has 3 ethernet ports on each unit. Aside from Orbi, there is no other mesh system (at least to my knowledge) that has this many ethernet ports at the back of the unit. Now, as far as installation of this product, it was a p.i.t.a. I could not get it to work properly. I would keep getting the dreaded \"red\" light during installation which means that it could not reach the internet. I tried rebooting this product and it worked for a few minutes until I updated it with the latest firmware. After updating, that was it! The red light on the unit would not go away. Without hesitation, I packed it up and returned it and bought another brand which by the way, has currently no issues."

They do cost more, but you can always be assured that the quality of the unit will be top-notch. That being said, PLEASE check your order when you get it to make sure you did not get a third-party knockoff like I did when you were expecting - and ordered - an OEM unit. It appeared that some other customer gamed the returns system and returned a non-Apple charger in the box of a real one, which was then not properly inspected and subsequently sold to me by Amazon Warehouse under the listing of an OEM product with cosmetic damage to the box.  Some things to look out for from the unit I received:  1: no Apple logo on the actual charging brick. 2: faded and smudged unit information stamped on the side of the brick. Apple\"s text rarely fades or smudges even on mistreated units. 3: velcro cable management strips on the cable. Apple has never included these. 4: no option to add the included extension cable.  While in a perfect world it is up to Amazon to due proper due diligence and inspect the items they receive as returns, it is also up to us as consumers and customers to make sure that we get what we pay for and that what we receive matches the listing that led us to purchase it.

Good software features  Cons: 1. The huge * itself, which is POOR RANGE. Now allow me to elaborate. I was trying to setup an extender which is about 15 meters away, with only a glass door in between and clear line of sight. I go to the extender position and look at the signal strength and WOW 5 bars, almost no signal lost (at least i believed) even in my garage where wifi has never reached i got 1 bar. So theoretically this had GREAT range. But no. As soon as my extender connected, the connection dropped and SSID even dissapeared. That was weird, so i pulled out my cellphone thinking the extender was bad. Same result, got 5 bars signal but as soon as i connected, connection dropped and SSID disappeared. Tested 2 more cellphones, 2 laptops, a Nintendo Switch, all to which gave me the exact same result. I closed in to the router with all devices and with a whole day of testing concluded that the signal could be reliably held with ANY device being 5 meters or closer. Thats right, 5 meters. Then i thought, maybe my house is over a iron ore or something. No, i bout a $20 linksys ac1200 and could easily reach the extender 15m away and even more with a stable and reliable signal. Curious is that at about 20m, this router does \"appear\" to have more signal strength than the ac1200, but as soon as connection is attempted, connection drops and SSID dissapears.  I would have given it 0 stars, but i guess anything in a 5m radius works well. but totally a BAD ROUTER if what you are looking for is range. If all your devices are 5m o nearer then i guess this is good for that.  Tried all firmwares on the support page and nothing fixed this issue."

            "top_reviews": "The Xfiniity compatible Modem was super easy to set-up following the Quick Start guide included in the box. Word of advice for Comcast / Xfinity subscribers -- when stepping through the set-up Wizard, selecting the option to text an activation code is a joke -- the code is only good for 15 minutes but I didn\"t receive the text until 30 minutes had passed; just stick with your Xfinity account name for the activation and provisioning.  Xfinity upgraded to DOCSIS 3.1, and, while my own 6 year old trusty Motorola Surfboard SB6580 was working fine, Xfinity found every reason to pester me about an upgrade and how much I\"m missing not having a 3.1 modem lease an upgrade. I prefer to own my own modem, so, after perusing compatible modems for my region on Xfinity\"s approved device page, I narrowed my choices to the ARRIS Surfboard SB8200, Netgear CM1000, and, this, the Motorola MB8600. All three are comparable at 1001 Mbps, 32 down x 8 up DOCSIS channels, and DOCSIS 3.1.  All the cool kids love the Arris -- especially after they ditched the very problematic Intel PUMA chipset and went with the Broadcom\"s offering -- and for very good reasons, it has great hardware specs. Sporting 3GB of RAM, 128MB /16 of NAND flash memory it\"s a tasty treat. And, were it not a horrific white box that clashes with everything in my apartment, I\"d happily have purchased it.  Vanity, thy name be Monkey Rat, I know.  I\"ve never had a lot of love for Netgear, and, I found its hardware lacking -- 128 MB of flash memory and 256 MB of RAM. Ultimately not a huge game changer, with current theoretical home speeds at 1Gb, but one would expect something a tad more, well, more from a name like Netgear. While its feature rich -- which, is saying something for a cable modem -- I really saw no reason to down this path.  That clashing white Arris was looking tastier at this point.  Then I compared the MB8600 to both and found a happy place. 512 MB of RAM and 128 MB of NAN -- a buck cheaper than the Netgear with a doubling of the RAM, and while not as expensive -- marginally -- than the Arris, and certainly lacking a bit in the hardware department, but I paid more for future ability to bond upwards of 4 separate lines. However, the LACP technology requires a higher end router, and faster than a gig speed isn\"t necessarily right around the corner, but, this device positioned nicely for a future with a potential of 4Gb.  Word of caution -- it\"s a BIG device. If you\"re familiar with the older Surfboards, this is easily double the size in height and does not come with any sort of mounting option. However, it has great ventilation thanks to a well aired grid pattern on the side.  So, how does it work? My internet plan is the BLAST! 150 Mbps (stop laughing) -- and i assure you, I\"ve never seen that even in the dead of night -- wired speeds show an increase on speedtest.net but it\"s not really all that noticeable, whether plugged in directly to the cable modem or my ASUS RT-AC86U router, notebook and desktop performance were negligible. However, wireless performance for my nVidia SHIELD K1 tablet and Google Pixel 2 phone were significantly improved - I found this a little odd as they\"re still going through a router, but, I can\"t argue with results.  I keep forgetting the MB8600 has a baked in spectrum analyzer utility I need to check out -- I\"ll add an update when I do.  Ultimately, I like it -- I play Everquest (the original) and noted better response times, but again, the MS aren\"t earth shaking or setting the sky afire. Stream the occasional movie, and really I don\"t have any complaints, and can only praise the device for its eye-popping Wi-Fi boost, for which I have no good explanation.  I may change out my Cat5e for Cat6 and upgrade my router next -- hopefully wringing a couple more Mbps out. But, really, I think it\"s time to call xfinity and have to do some line tests. I will provide updates on that as well."

It\"s really easy to switch between tent mode, tablet mode, or laptop mode. 2 USB ports is kind of limiting.  The pen works really well. The plastic piece that attaches to the USB port is really cheap feeling and doesn\"t hold the pen upright (even though there\"s a hole on top as if it\"s supposed to) but it\"s not a big deal. Out of the box it doesn\"t seem to be as smooth as the lens like from the Samsung tab S7 plus, but I\"m sure it just takes some messing with the settings.  The battery life is really good. I\"d say it\"s on par with laptops. You could get by almost the whole day without charging and if you need to, it charges pretty quickly.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 9, 2019 (5/5 stars) UPDATED REVIEW: June 21, 2019 (4/5 stars)  For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 \u2013 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 \u20138th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the \u201cSaving Money on Purchases\u201d section).  This device is Amazon\u2019s most recently refreshed (2019 \u2013 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.  Below is my summary of the \u201cFire 7.\u201d I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.  -THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.  - AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.  - Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model: --- Display size remains the same --- PPI remains the same at 171 --- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM. --- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone) --- Size specifications remain the same --- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)  - Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017. --- Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB). --- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version. --- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging. --- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available. --- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version. --- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams) --- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page). --- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.  - Technical specs and other details: --- Size: 7.6\u201d x 4.5\u201d x 0.4\u201d (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm). --- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles. --- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback --- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB --- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases. --- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams --- Amazon\u2019s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for \u201cMashed Potatoes\u201d and it will do so. --- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7) --- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera --- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor --- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life --- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used) --- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication. No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. --- Bluetooth 4.1 LE --- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker.  - Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series): --- No HD video viewing available --- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out) --- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker) --- Sound quality is average --- Amazon\u2019s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store. --- Amazon\u2019s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.). --- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced). --- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.  -Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.  - Comparison between Fire 7 (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g) --- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs..

Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)  ** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).  - Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list) --- Accessibility: \u201cVoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.\u201d --- Surfing the web using Amazon\u2019s web browser - Silk --- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music. --- Ability to read Kindle books. --- Ability to read the news using Washington Times --- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon\u2019s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. --- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc. --- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.  - Testing: Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.  - Saving money on purchasing the Fire: --- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card. --- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet. --- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers.. --- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire. --- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item. --- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.  -Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).  - Conclusion: To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store. Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.  - UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8 I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).  - UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited - Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period) --- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over \u201c20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids\" profiles to give them more access to apps and games.\u201d \u201cIn FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.\u201d Another unique feature is Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish! --- Parents also have the option \u201cto set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.\u201d --- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value \u2013 I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends). *FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.  UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019): Battery Life and Software Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven\u2019t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.  Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.  Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!"

It\u2019s perfect, here\u2019s why. - The battery life is great. - The fact that it only displays downloads when we are somewhere with no wifi, saves me one million questions. (Amazon should honestly market that in the blurb.) - The parental controls are easy and I can pick and choose which ones he can use. - The expandable storage is so easy. He can take all the photos and videos that he wants and I won\u2019t have to clear them out every couple of weeks to make more room. - We did not download the YouTube Kids app and it\u2019s life changing. No more bizarrely sexist videos of grown woman playing with dolls. However, we still have Blippi. - Love having access to Kids+ - Love all of the traditional Kindle/Prime features (books, music, educational games, non-educational games) - The kickstand is amazing and does not fall over of my child breathes on it. It\u2019s also a great handle.  Things to note - My child is 4 1/2 - He\u2019s had an iPad for an embarrassing long time, so he is super comfortable using a tablet. - We had gotten him a kindle fire 7 and just put a kids profile on it a couple years ago and this upgrade makes all the difference in the world. - We are a kindle family, so the interface is not new or foreign to us.  Honestly, I love this over the iPad for my kid, because the iPad is not made for children. It is durable, absolutely. However, the fire is made for him and it\u2019s laid out in a way that I know what he is watching and when he goes to download games and videos, they are appropriate."

            "top_reviews": "I traded \"up\" from my older Fire Tablet. Used the older to watch movies I had on SD\\\"s. When I got the new tablet it would not recognize my movies SD. They were in MP4 format. So I called customer and got a whirlwind of agents that border on incompetent claiming they \"knew\" but did not. They had me do a reset wiping out all I already had downloaded from previous tablet. That did NOTHING, same issue. Next agent told me that I could ONLY use one of two \"approved\" SD\\\"s,which I knew was untrue from a latter agent. Then I get an email from unknown customer agent that the SD\\\"s had to be formatted only FAT32 not exFat32 which is in direct contradiction to the tablet help files. So on and on with numerous calls with some \"pretending\" to be advanced Tech support but did not know about formatting in FAT32 or other from9 am until late at night. One was supposed to call back in 20 minutes did not. Another when I asked what country they were calling from ( asked because of the time zone difference) said that was rude and just hung up the phone.  Now I find out it is supposed to be a Generation 11 2021 table but when you look in the \"about Tablet\" in the Setting it states Gen 10. You also cannot use the \"Play Store\" but only their App Store keeping it Proprietary like computers did 40 years ago. And it is not really a true Android.  All in all this tablet is not worth the trouble unless you just content with Amazon shopping and Prime watching. After a supervisor is \"supposed\"to call me back June 2 ( three days) and see if they resolved the MP4 SD issue I will return it unless resolved. I have 17 - 32 gb SD\\\"s each with 30+ movies on each (510) I have been watching on my previous Fire Tablet. I will be darned if I am going to save all those, reformat the disk, and reinstall them on the disk for a crappy new Fire tablet and worse customer Service for it.  UPDATE:!!! Well the supervisor that was supposed to call me never has. So I called and got another\"Expert\" that has done exactly the same thing all the rest did and was going to send me another tablet until I seen in the reviews that others have had the same issues. You cannot use this tablet unless you format the SD in their machine and then transfer whatever you want to put on it.  Now do want to even return my \"Gift Card\" I applied to this order. So they want to keep my old table, keep my gift card. And I have to drive 35 miles to return this shitty table.  HERE IS THE AMAZON CON. THEY DID AN \"UPDATE\" AND CHANGED THE WORDS GENERATION 10 TO \"TABLET 10 (11TH GENERATION)\" AND NOW THEY WANT TO KEEP MY OLD TABLET AND THE $30 CREDIT FOR SENDING IT IN ."

            "top_reviews": "Original review (June 9, 2019) and three updates placed at the end of the original review (June 10, 2019, June 14, 2019, and June 21, 2019, respectively).  ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 9, 2019 (5/5 stars) UPDATED REVIEW: June 21, 2019 (4/5 stars)  For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 \u2013 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 \u20138th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the \u201cSaving Money on Purchases\u201d section).  This device is Amazon\u2019s most recently refreshed (2019 \u2013 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.  Below is my summary of the \u201cFire 7.\u201d I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.  -THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.  - AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.  - Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model: --- Display size remains the same --- PPI remains the same at 171 --- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM. --- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone) --- Size specifications remain the same --- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)  - Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017. --- Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB). --- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version. --- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging. --- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available. --- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version. --- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams) --- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page). --- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.  - Technical specs and other details: --- Size: 7.6\u201d x 4.5\u201d x 0.4\u201d (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm). --- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles. --- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback --- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB --- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases. --- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams --- Amazon\u2019s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for \u201cMashed Potatoes\u201d and it will do so. --- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7) --- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera --- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor --- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life --- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used) --- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication. No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. --- Bluetooth 4.1 LE --- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker.  - Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series): --- No HD video viewing available --- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out) --- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker) --- Sound quality is average --- Amazon\u2019s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store. --- Amazon\u2019s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.). --- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced). --- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.  -Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.  - Comparison between Fire 7 (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g) --- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point) --- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.  - Comparison between Fire 7 (this version \u2013 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release \u2013 mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8) --- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera) --- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)] --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)  ** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).  - Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list) --- Accessibility: \u201cVoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.\u201d --- Surfing the web using Amazon\u2019s web browser - Silk --- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music. --- Ability to read Kindle books. --- Ability to read the news using Washington Times --- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon\u2019s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. --- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc. --- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.  - Testing: Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.  - Saving money on purchasing the Fire: --- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card. --- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet. --- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers.. --- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire. --- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item. --- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.  -Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).  - Conclusion: To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store. Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.  - UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8 I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).  - UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited - Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period) --- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over \u201c20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids\" profiles to give them more access to apps and games.\u201d \u201cIn FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.\u201d Another unique feature is Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish! --- Parents also have the option \u201cto set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.\u201d --- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value \u2013 I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends). *FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.  UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019): Battery Life and Software Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven\u2019t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.  Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.  Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section. Thank you!"

            "top_reviews": "I purchased the Arris SB8200 for Xfinity Gigabit Internet service as they have a deal for two years for the same price as the 400Mbps plan ($69.99). So in order to save almost $15 a month I decided to buy my own modem to replace my aging Motorola (Arris) SB6141. My SB6141 netted me 259Mbps down and 35Mbps up on my previous plan of 400Mbps down and 35Mbps up, which is great for a 8x4 channel Docsis 3.0 cable modem. So since Arris bought Motorola modem cable division I decided to get another one having had a great product with the 6141. The Arris SB8200 is also the only Docsis 3.1 modem with two Ethernet ports capable of doing 2Gbps down and is the most future proof of any modem on the market at the time of writing this review. And you can get a refurbished model for half the price which is even better!  Inside the Arris SB8200 is a Broadcom BCM3390 chipset (a much needed change from the SB6190\u2019s Intel Puma 6 chipset which had hardware bugs and caused them a lawsuit for good measure), 3GB of RAM, 128MB S34ML01G200TFV00 Spansion flash memory NAND and 16MB Macronix MX25L12805D SPI NAND flash memory. The SB8200 is capable of downstream bonded channels up to 32 SCQAM or 2 OFDM and upstream bonded channels up to 8 SCQAM or 2 OFDMA (32x8 SCQAM and 2x2 OFDM). The Ethernet ports are only Gigabit Ethernet and therefore the Max you will get is 950Mbps average down and it will never be possible to the the boxes 10Gbps selling spiel. Even if you don\"t have Docsis 3.1 in your area or a Gigabit internet speed plan this modem will serve you for many years to come. And this modem has 3GB of RAM, which the other Docsis 3.1 modems have 256MB or less! RAM! Oh and with most providers (Xfinity included) you can call them and add a separate IP address for the second Ethernet port for a small fee (Xfinity charges like $5.95 if I\"m remembering correctly). This would be great if you wanted to connect a gaming console directly to the modem for the best speeds and then connect your home router to the second. And eventually you\"ll be able to kick in 2Gbps by merging those two Ethernet ports!  Setup of the device was quick and easy and you simply plugin the coxial cable, Ethernet cable to your device (router for 99% of the people) and power cable and you are off and running. A quick call to your internet provider (Xfinity for me) to add the HFC MAC address and the modem is registered and provisioned and I\"m up and running within ten minutes. Xfinity will try to send out a tech but you can get them to override it if you know what you are doing. Gigabit internet can be extremely temperamental as we\"ll discuss later which is the reason Xfinity requires sending out a tech on all Gigabit plan installs. And again this is simply a modem so you will need a router if you want wifi or the ability to connect more than one device.  The performance of the Arris SB8200 is top notch and I was easily able to pull my provisioned modem speeds from my Xfinity service. I was able to test 1.4Gbps down (Fast.com also includes backend speed as actual can only be 950Mbps as I mentioned above) and 45Mbps up. On Speedtest.net my tests are almost always 930-960Mbps (or near that) down and 40-50Mbps up. These speeds are AMAZING and just my upload speed is faster than most people\"s download speeds! Right now Xfinity is only utilizing Docsis 3.1 for the downstream channels so the modem lights will have a blue light for downstream and a green light for upstream (this is not an error or bug).  My issues arose with my Xfinity service and resets, slow speeds (300Mbps Max down), etc. Xfinity sent out a tech and that did nothing. So another rech came and found a ton of ingress coming from 4 lines on my tap. He trapped them off and I was up and running with Gigabit speeds again. Then the resets started, at night almost every 10 minutes! It was only happening between 10pm and 7am average, EVERY NIGHT! I had more techs out, supervisors and more supervisors! After a month (and many hours of my time and speaking up) the issue was resolved as it was a bad line amplifier which was causing noise and caring my upstream to spike into the high 50s, which triggers resets on the modem and t3/t4 errors. Now my neighbors were having issues on certain channels and slow internet but their modems WERE NOT RESETTING! And we knew my modem wasn\"t bad as it was fine for over 12 hours a day with no errors at all in the log until night began to fall everyday. And In fact my neighbors never lost internet, EVER but my internet was almost useless at night time. So the Arris SB8200 is extremely sensitive to t3/t4 errors and the threshold for errors and resets is much higher for the Xfinity owned gateways and modems. Also Arris had out out a firmware update previously about severe sensitivity to t3/t4 errors and I had the latest version but I was still having issues so they still need to work on this. If you are experiencing issues with your Arris modem navigate to http://192.168.100.1 and you\"ll be able to see basic signal information, modem error logs, modem and firmware info. You can use this information and post it in the support forums to get help and diagnose any problems.  But now that the line and backend errors are corrected it\"s smooth sailing and I\"m saving myself a ton of money (the new Xfinity modem charge is $14 plus tax and it will be $15 by the beginning of 2020 so you pay for the modem in a little over a year) every year and you\"ll have the newest technology that is even better than the Xfinity modems and gateways, many of which use the Puma 6 chipset which I mentioned above (causing severe lag and timeouts which can kill online gaming or video watching). So I\"m paying $69.99 and getting Gigabit speeds of 950Mbps down and 48Mbps up which is a great deal hands down and you won\"t find speeds that cheap ANYWHERE ELSE! The Arris brand is keeping the Motorola spirit alive and kicking which is great for competition! The Arris SB8200 is the best modem you can buy for your money right now and if you can find a refurbished unit on Amazon even better (they didn\"t have any when I bought mine but three weeks later they did and for $100 cheaper)!"

They were in MP4 format. So I called customer and got a whirlwind of agents that border on incompetent claiming they \"knew\" but did not. They had me do a reset wiping out all I already had downloaded from previous tablet. That did NOTHING, same issue. Next agent told me that I could ONLY use one of two \"approved\" SD\\\"s,which I knew was untrue from a latter agent. Then I get an email from unknown customer agent that the SD\\\"s had to be formatted only FAT32 not exFat32 which is in direct contradiction to the tablet help files. So on and on with numerous calls with some \"pretending\" to be advanced Tech support but did not know about formatting in FAT32 or other from9 am until late at night. One was supposed to call back in 20 minutes did not. Another when I asked what country they were calling from ( asked because of the time zone difference) said that was rude and just hung up the phone.  Now I find out it is supposed to be a Generation 11 2021 table but when you look in the \"about Tablet\" in the Setting it states Gen 10. You also cannot use the \"Play Store\" but only their App Store keeping it Proprietary like computers did 40 years ago. And it is not really a true Android.  All in all this tablet is not worth the trouble unless you just content with Amazon shopping and Prime watching. After a supervisor is \"supposed\"to call me back June 2 ( three days) and see if they resolved the MP4 SD issue I will return it unless resolved. I have 17 - 32 gb SD\\\"s each with 30+ movies on each (510) I have been watching on my previous Fire Tablet. I will be darned if I am going to save all those, reformat the disk, and reinstall them on the disk for a crappy new Fire tablet and worse customer Service for it.  UPDATE:!!! Well the supervisor that was supposed to call me never has. So I called and got another\"Expert\" that has done exactly the same thing all the rest did and was going to send me another tablet until I seen in the reviews that others have had the same issues. You cannot use this tablet unless you format the SD in their machine and then transfer whatever you want to put on it.  Now do want to even return my \"Gift Card\" I applied to this order. So they want to keep my old table, keep my gift card. And I have to drive 35 miles to return this shitty table.  HERE IS THE AMAZON CON. THEY DID AN \"UPDATE\" AND CHANGED THE WORDS GENERATION 10 TO \"TABLET 10 (11TH GENERATION)\" AND NOW THEY WANT TO KEEP MY OLD TABLET AND THE $30 CREDIT FOR SENDING IT IN ."

            "top_reviews": "This is my third Kindle Fire device. I had the HDX for years then gifted it to my son. I then ordered the 8 Plus most recently and have generally enjoyed it. However, as someone that has a giant phone with me, I came to realize that the screen just wasn\u2019t big enough to justify using it regularly. Enter the new HD 10 Plus with its larger screen. My assumption was that, for the most part, this would basically be a larger version the 8. Generally, my assumption was correct but Amazon did a very nice job of tweaking some areas that desperately needed it. I will detail some of those tweaks here but, at its core, this tablet is still very much just a very reasonably priced entertainment device. I think some folks misunderstand the intent from Amazon here. The Fire line up is designed to meet the demands of most tablet owner\u2019s needs; streaming music, streaming Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix, handling emails, general web browsing and more. I know, Amazon is offering a \u201cproductivity bundle\u201d here and it is nice to see Amazon trying to make these more flexible but, make no mistake, there is a reason that companies like Apple and Samsung charge so much more for their devices. However, if you aren\u2019t expecting an iPad like experience, I think most folks should be genuinely happy with the HD 10 Plus. It does an awful lot incredibly well! Here is the breakdown:  -The Screen: One of my biggest complaints about the Fire 8 Plus was the screen. It felt dull and lifeless to me. Functional and fine for a movie or bopping around online indoors but not a vibrant experience. Part of the issue is, so many of us have phones with these crazy perfect panels on them now. HD+, FHD+, WQHD+, and more! Plus, some of have adaptive refresh rates. I mean these screens are amazing today! These phones often cost over $1,000. So, for devices that retail at less than $250, it would not be fair to expect that level of screen quality. That being said, Amazon has definitely improved things here. We get 1080p HD and the screen does not feel as laggy or slow to me. Further, it is noticeably brighter to my eyes which was probably my single biggest complaint about the 8. You will not want to try and stream a show on a bright day on the beach, but it just looks and performs better overall. Combined now with the bigger screen size and I think this panel might actually be a strength of the new 10. Well done!  -Form Factor: I loved the Fire 8 Plus with one big nitpick: GIGANTIC bezels! This 10 still has big ones but they feel so much smaller to me. Good stuff. The device feels good in the hand. Solid! Amazon claims a twelve-hour battery. I am seeing at least that. This thing is a beast with battery life!! Charging is handled via USBC or wireless. There is an included 9W brick but make sure to find a 15W brick as that is this tablet\u2019s max charging capability. You will see much faster speeds. I have not had to recharge yet but figure around three hours. As with the last gen 8 Plus the wireless charging was a great inclusion at this price Amazon! With 4GB of RAM and a slightly upgraded RealTek processor, I was expecting this to be faster and smoother. Frankly, I am just not sure. Maybe a little bit. It handles everything I have thrown at it. It is a marginal improvement over the last 8 Plus in this regard. If you were hoping for huge speed and performance upgrades over the 8 Plus, do not bother here. It is smoother but it is somewhat negligible. Amazon is claiming almost 2x the durability in drop testing over the latest iPad 10.2 with significantly strengthened glass. Time will tell on that, but this is good news. Additionally, like the 8 Plus, this can be dropped in Amazon\u2019s $50 wireless dock and it will basically become an Echo Show. Pretty slick! I opted for the 64GB model (there is also 32GB) but you can add up to 1TB via expandable memory. Unlike many others, Amazon still supports a good old-fashioned 3.5mm stereo jack. There is a 2MP front-facing camera and a 5MP rear camera that shoots up to 720p video. If you have a smartphone built in the last 4 years, you will want to skip anything but, perhaps, a Zoom meeting. The cameras produce below average images by today\u2019s standards. This is an okay place to make a save in my opinion. The speakers here are improved over the 8 Plus but are still just average.  -Connectivity: You get 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz WiFi here for networking and Bluetooth 5.0 LE. In my experience so far, I have had very stable WiFi connection to my home network with solid range. Additionally, as I would expect with this version of Bluetooth, my connection to my ear buds has been strong and can get 50\u2019 plus of range.  -Other Important Thoughts: I cannot find any codec support from either Amazon or Realtek. I did not anticipate that here. Despite that, I see very little latency when streaming video. Know though that, when streaming music services, do not bother with cranking up the stream quality. This device will not handle anything but fairly compressed audio. Fine in a pinch but an iPhone with AAC or an Android with AptX (at a minimum) will sound better. Amazon does let you go to split screen here to take advantage of the bigger real estate. I do not anticipate using it but you could watch a video on Netflix and answer emails at the same time. Might be handy to some. You will hear grumbling about the Amazon app store in some of the reviews. It happens every time they release a new device. As a long time Fire tablet and Android user, I will say that I have never understood Amazon\u2019s decision here. Just so much work for a substandard result! That said, I doubt too many of you will find many apps missing. Amazon has given us access to all the big-name apps here. There might be some niche missing stuff but 98% of consumers will likely be pleased here. If you are wondering whether to pay for ad removal or not, I always go for the ads. Only on my reading Kindle\u2019s have I paid to remove them. It is not expensive to remove them, but they are only on the lock screen. I swipe the screen and they disappear. Inconsequential to me but, if they bother you, you can pay any time (even after purchase) to remove them so, if you are a first time Fire buyer, I recommend taking the save initially to see how you feel about them. Also, plan on buying the Amazon brand case. It has a premium feel and protects the tablet nicely. It also offers a unique approach to standing the device both in portrait and landscape modes. Well done.  Conclusion: So, I need to spend more time here and will update as I go but, given the similarities to the 8 Plus, I am confident in my early recommendation. In comparison, I just cannot tell you guys what a difference the size difference makes. Between the smaller bezels and the increased screen size, this feels like a completely different device. The bigger brighter screen just makes consuming all forms of media a much better experience. I did not opt for the \u201cProductivity Package\u201d because, candidly, I just cannot see using this device for work stuff. The point of Fire devices, at least for me, is to just have an inexpensive entertainment machine. Again, I hate to dismiss the idea without trying it but I just do not think a RealTek processor is capable of creating a really robust experience for work and it doesn\u2019t matter how many free Microsoft apps you get thrown into the deal. At just over $200, I am perfectly fine with this. I embrace what Amazon has created here. One other important note: If you have an old Fire device, like the HDX lying around, Amazon gives you 20% off here and $15 for the device, assuming it is still operational. That was a $60 savings for me which is much more than the device was worth. The HD 10 Plus is a well-made high value device that makes entertainment on the fly easy. Whether you want to watch something on Amazon or HBO, do some gaming, fire off some emails, or just surf around the net, this 10.1\u201d Fire tablet will put a smile on your face. I will update this review as I go here but, at least for me, this is an easy recommendation. Nice work to the Amazon team here yet again!  *Update* So it has been over a week and I am more pleased than I was initially. This is exactly what I wanted. The screen is really good. I no longer miss my S21 Ultra when watching video during my elliptical sessions. It is also snappier than I thought initially. Moving around the tablet and interacting with various apps feels more responsive than the last 8 to me for sure. Amazon does include the AAC codec here so Apple users will have optimized audio when listening to music. I finally found that information. All and all, for the price, I continue to be amazed. Will update further but buy with complete confidence."

It will provide fantastic speeds and will be a nice upgrade for older routers not capable of keeping up with the increasing internet speeds provided today by most ISPs.  Unfortunately, Netgear decided to dramatically change the internal components and then still sell it under the same name (R6700). With that said, Amazon has a little product alert indicating either R6700 or R6700v2. Well, they are shipping the R6700v2 which does not match some of the specifications shown on this page (in particular the CPU speed).  I know because after receiving a router that did not match, they offered to replace it and send the first version of the router (the one with the higher clock speeds as indicated on the actual product details) and ended up receiving the same thing (another V2).  I will say that for those interested in a router that will not be flashed with custom software or that will not use other more advanced functions a router can provide, this is no problem. For those of us that know the hardware and know what we are expecting, that is a problem.  I have it a 3 star because any company that makes an original version with better specs and then turns around and significantly changes this without changing the model number and making minor modifications on the box (see amazon\"s own photos - both boxes are pictured) simply does not deserve my trust. Speaking of ratings, many of the ratings you see here are lumped up with other Netgear products and also apply to the original more capable version.  I encourage you do your research and check reviews from different sources. This way, you will not be disappointed with the V2 that you will receive. I hope this help you make your decision!"

            "top_reviews": "I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like. My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip. A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop \"umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you\\\"re going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store\". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude. Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it\\\"s not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that\\\"s what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don\\\"t really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud. Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I\\\"ve been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1."

They had me do a reset wiping out all I already had downloaded from previous tablet. That did NOTHING, same issue. Next agent told me that I could ONLY use one of two \"approved\" SD\\\"s,which I knew was untrue from a latter agent. Then I get an email from unknown customer agent that the SD\\\"s had to be formatted only FAT32 not exFat32 which is in direct contradiction to the tablet help files. So on and on with numerous calls with some \"pretending\" to be advanced Tech support but did not know about formatting in FAT32 or other from9 am until late at night. One was supposed to call back in 20 minutes did not. Another when I asked what country they were calling from ( asked because of the time zone difference) said that was rude and just hung up the phone.  Now I find out it is supposed to be a Generation 11 2021 table but when you look in the \"about Tablet\" in the Setting it states Gen 10. You also cannot use the \"Play Store\" but only their App Store keeping it Proprietary like computers did 40 years ago. And it is not really a true Android.  All in all this tablet is not worth the trouble unless you just content with Amazon shopping and Prime watching. After a supervisor is \"supposed\"to call me back June 2 ( three days) and see if they resolved the MP4 SD issue I will return it unless resolved. I have 17 - 32 gb SD\\\"s each with 30+ movies on each (510) I have been watching on my previous Fire Tablet. I will be darned if I am going to save all those, reformat the disk, and reinstall them on the disk for a crappy new Fire tablet and worse customer Service for it.  UPDATE:!!! Well the supervisor that was supposed to call me never has. So I called and got another\"Expert\" that has done exactly the same thing all the rest did and was going to send me another tablet until I seen in the reviews that others have had the same issues. You cannot use this tablet unless you format the SD in their machine and then transfer whatever you want to put on it.  Now do want to even return my \"Gift Card\" I applied to this order. So they want to keep my old table, keep my gift card. And I have to drive 35 miles to return this shitty table.  HERE IS THE AMAZON CON.
